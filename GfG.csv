0,Soul Food Horns,Oak,"pythagoras comes to the city of crotona, and teaches the principles of his philosophy. his reputation draws numa pompilius to hear his discourses; on which he expounds his principles, and, more especially, enlarges on the transmigration of the soul, and the practice of eating animal food. nl there was a man, a samian by birth; but he had fled from both samos and its rulers,8 and, through hatred of tyranny, he was a voluntary exile. he too, mentally, held converse with the gods, although far distant in the region of the heavens; and what nature refused to human vision, he viewed with the eyes of his mind. and when he had examined all things with his mind, and with watchful study, he gave them to be learned by the public; and he sought the crowds of people as they sat in silence, and wondered at the revealed origin of the vast universe, and the cause of things, and what nature meant, and what was god; whence came the snow, what was the cause of lightning; whether it was jupiter, or whether the winds that thundered when the cloud was rent asunder; what it was that shook the earth; by what laws the stars took their course; and whatever besides lay concealed from mortals. nl he, too, was the first to forbid animals to be served up at table, and he was the first that opened his lips, learned indeed, but still not obtaining credit, in such words as these: “forbear, mortals, to pollute your bodies with such abominable food. there is the corn; there are the apples that bear down the branches by their weight, and there are the grapes swelling upon the vines; there are the herbs that are pleasant; there are some that can become tender, and be softened by the action of fire. the flowing milk, too, is not denied you, nor honey redolent of the bloom of the thyme. the lavish earth yields her riches, and her agreable food, and affords dainties without slaughter and bloodshed. the beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh; and yet not all of them; for the horse, and the sheep, and the herds subsist on grass. nl but those whose disposition is cruel and fierce, the armenian tigers, and the raging lions, and the bears together with the wolves, revel in their diet with blood. alas! what a crime is it, for entrails to be buried in entrails, and for one ravening body to grow fat on other carcases crammed into it; and for one living creature to exist through the death of another living creature! and does, forsooth! amid so great an abundance, which the earth, that best of mothers, produces, nothing delight you but to gnaw with savage teeth the sad produce of your wounds, and to revive the habits of the cyclops? and can you not appease the hunger of a voracious and ill-regulated stomach unless you first destroy another? but that age of old, to which we have given the name of ‘golden,’ was blest in the produce of the trees, and in the herbs which the earth produces, and it did not pollute the mouth with blood. nl “then, both did the birds move their wings in safety in the air, and the hare without fear wander in the midst of the fields; then its own credulity had not suspended the fish from the hook; every place was without treachery, and in dread of no injury, and was full of peace. afterwards, some one, no good adviser9 (whoever among mortals he might have been), envied this simple food, and engulphed in his greedy paunch victuals made from a carcase; ’twas he that opened the path to wickedness; and i can believe that the steel, since stained with blood, first grew warm from the slaughter of wild beasts. and that had been sufficient. i confess that the bodies of animals that seek our destruction are put to death with no breach of the sacred laws; but, although they might be put to death, yet they were not to be eaten as well. then this wickedness proceeded still further; and the swine is believed to have deserved death as the first victim, because it grubbed up the seeds with its turned-up snout, and cut short the hopes of the year. having gnawed the vine, the goat was led10 for slaughter to the altars of the avenging bacchus. their own faults were the ruin of the two. but why have you deserved this, ye sheep? a harmless breed, and born for the service of man; who carry the nectar in your full udders; who afford your wool as soft coverings for us, and who assist us more by your life than by your death. why have the oxen deserved this, an animal without guile and deceit, innocent, harmless, born to endure labour? in fact, the man is ungrateful, and not worthy of the gifts of the harvest, who could, just after taking off the weight of the curving plough, slaughter the tiller of his fields; who could strike, with the axe, that neck worn bare with labour, through which he had so oft turned up the hard ground, and had afforded so many a harvest. nl “and it is not enough for such wickedness to be committed; they have imputed to the gods themselves this abomination; and they believe that a deity in the heavens can rejoice in the slaughter of the laborious ox. a victim free from a blemish, and most beauteous in form (for ’tis being sightly that brings destruction), adorned with garlands and gold, is placed upon the altars, and, in its ignorance, it hears one praying, and sees the corn, which it has helped to produce, placed on its forehead between its horns; and, felled, it stains with its blood the knives perhaps before seen by it in the limpid water. immediately, they examine the entrails snatched from its throbbing breast, and in them they seek out the intentions of the deities. whence comes it that men have so great a hankering for forbidden food? do you presume to feed on flesh, o race of mortals? do it not, i beseech you; and give attention to my exhortations. and when you shall be presenting the limbs of slaughtered oxen to your palates, know and consider that you are devouring your tillers of the ground. and since a god impels me to speak, i will duly obey the god that so prompts me to speak; and i will pronounce my own delphic warnings, and disclose the heavens themselves; and i will reveal the oracles of the divine will. i will sing of wondrous things, never investigated by the intellects of the ancients, and things which have long lain concealed. it delights me to range among the lofty stars; it delights me, having left the earth and this sluggish spot far behind, to be borne amid the clouds, and to be supported on the shoulders of the mighty atlas; and to look down from afar on minds wandering in uncertainty, and devoid of reason; and so to advise them alarmed and dreading extinction, and to unfold the range of things ordained by fate. nl “o race! stricken by the alarms of icy death, why do you dread styx? why the shades, why empty names, the stock subjects of the poets, and the atonements of an imaginary world? whether the funeral pile consumes your bodies with flames, or old age with gradual dissolution, believe that they cannot suffer any injury. souls are not subject to death; and having left their former abode, they ever inhabit new dwellings, and, there received, live on. nl “i, myself, for i remember it, in the days of the trojan war, was euphorbus,11 the son of panthoüs, in whose opposing breast once was planted the heavy spear of the younger son of atreus. i lately recognised the shield, once the burden of my left arm, in the temple of juno, at argos, the realm of abas. all things are ever changing; nothing perishes. the soul wanders about and comes from that spot to this, from this to that, and takes possession of any limbs whatever; it both passes from the beasts to human bodies, and so does our soul into the beasts; and in no lapse of time does it perish. and as the pliable wax is moulded into new forms, and no longer abides as it was before, nor preserves the same shape, but yet is still the same wax, so i tell you that the soul is ever the same, but passes into different forms. therefore, that natural affection may not be vanquished by the craving of the appetite, cease, i warn you, to expel the souls of your kindred from their bodies by this dreadful slaughter; and let not blood be nourished with blood. nl “and, since i am now borne over the wide ocean, and i have given my full sails to the winds, there is nothing in all the world that continues in the same state. all things are flowing onward,12 and every shape is assumed in a fleeting course. even time itself glides on with a constant progress, no otherwise than a river. for neither can the river, nor the fleeting hour stop in its course; but, as wave is impelled by wave, and the one before is pressed on by that which follows, and itself presses on that before it; so do the moments similarly fly on, and similarly do they follow, and they are ever renewed. for the moment which was before, is past; and that which was not, now exists; and every minute is replaced. you see, too, the night emerge and proceed onward to the dawn, and this brilliant light of the day succeed the dark night. nor is there the same appearance in the heavens, when all things in their weariness lie in the midst of repose, and when lucifer is coming forth on his white steed; and, again, there is another appearance, when aurora, the daughter of pallas, preceding the day, tints the world about to be delivered to phœbus. the disk itself of that god, when it is rising from beneath the earth, is of ruddy colour in the morning, and when it is hiding beneath the earth it is of a ruddy colour. at its height it is of brilliant whiteness, because there the nature of the æther is purer, and far away, he avoids all infection from the earth. nor can there ever be the same or a similar appearance of the nocturnal diana; and always that of the present day is less than on the morrow, if she is on the increase; but greater if she is contracting her orb. nl “and further. do you not see the year, affording a resemblance of our life, assume four different appearances? for, in early spring, it is mild, and like a nursling, and greatly resembling the age of youth. then, the blade is shooting, and void of strength, it swells, and is flaccid, and delights the husbandman in his expectations. then, all things are in blossom, and the genial meadow smiles with the tints of its flowers; and not as yet is there any vigour in the leaves. the year now waxing stronger, after the spring, passes into the summer; and in its youth it becomes robust. and indeed no season is there more vigorous, or more fruitful, or which glows with greater warmth. autumn follows, the ardour of youth now removed, ripe, and placed between youth and old age, moderate in his temperature, with a few white hairs sprinkled over his temples. then comes aged winter, repulsive with his tremulous steps, either stript of his locks, or white with those which he has. nl “our own bodies too are changing always and without any intermission, and to-morrow we shall not be what we were or what we now are. the time was, when only as embryos, and the earliest hope of human beings, we lived in the womb of the mother. nature applied her skilful hands, and willed not that our bodies should be tortured by being shut up within the entrails of the distended parent, and brought us forth from our dwelling into the vacant air. brought to light, the infant lies without any strength; soon, like a quadruped, it uses its limbs after the manner of the brutes; and by degrees it stands upright, shaking, and with knees still unsteady, the sinews being supported by some assistance. then he becomes strong and swift, and passes over the hours of youth; and the years of middle age, too, now past, he glides adown the steep path of declining age. this undermines and destroys the robustness of former years; and milo,13 now grown old, weeps when he sees the arms, which equalled those of hercules in the massiveness of the solid muscles, hang weak and exhausted. the daughter of tyndarus weeps, too, as she beholds in her mirror the wrinkles of old age, and enquires of herself why it is that she was twice ravished. thou, time, the consumer of all things, and thou, hateful old age, together destroy all things; and, by degrees ye consume each thing, decayed by the teeth of age, with a slow death. nl “these things too, which we call elements, are not of unchanging duration; pay attention, and i will teach you what changes they undergo. nl “the everlasting universe contains four elementary bodies. two of these, namely, earth and water, are heavy, and are borne downwards by their weight; and as many are devoid of weight, and air, and fire still purer than air, nothing pressing them, seek the higher regions. although these are separated in space, yet all things are made from them, and are resolved into them. both the earth dissolving distils into flowing water; the water, too, evaporating, departs in the breezes and the air; its weight being removed again, the most subtle air shoots upwards into the fires of the æther on high. thence do they return back again, and the same order is unravelled; for fire becoming gross, passes into dense air; this changes into water, and earth is formed of the water made dense. nor does its own form remain to each; and nature, the renewer of all things, re-forms one shape from another. and, believe me, in this universe so vast, nothing perishes; but it varies and changes its appearance; and to begin to be something different from what it was before, is called being born; and to cease to be the same thing, is to be said to die. whereas, perhaps, those things are transferred hither, and these things thither; yet, in the whole, all things ever exist. nl “for my part, i cannot believe that anything lasts long under the same form. ’twas thus, ye ages, that ye came down to the iron from the gold; ’tis thus, that thou hast so often changed the lot of various places. i have beheld that as sea, which once had been the most solid earth. i have seen land made from the sea; and far away from the ocean the sea-shells lay, and old anchors were found there on the tops of the mountains. that which was a plain, a current of water has made into a valley, and by a flood the mountain has been levelled into a plain; the ground that was swampy is parched with dry sand; and places which have endured drought, are wet with standing pools. here nature has opened fresh springs, but there she has shut them up; and rivers have burst forth, aroused by ancient earthquakes; or, vanishing, they have subsided. nl “thus, after the lycus14 has been swallowed up by a chasm in the earth, it burst forth far thence, and springs up afresh at another mouth. thus the great erasinus15 is at one time swallowed up, and then flowing with its stream concealed, is cast up again on the argive plains. they say, too, that the mysus, tired of its spring and of its former banks, now flows in another direction, as the caicus. the amenanus,16 too, at one time flows, rolling along the sicilian sands, and at another is dry, its springs being stopped up. formerly, the water of the anigros17 was used for drinking; it now pours out water which you would decline to touch; since, (unless all credit must be denied to the poets), the centaurs, the double-limbed mortals, there washed the wounds which the bow of the club-bearing hercules had made. and what besides? does not the hypanis18 too, which before was sweet, rising from the scythian mountains, become impregnated with bitter salts? antissa,19 pharos,20 and phœnician tyre,21 were once surrounded by waves; no one of these is now an island. the ancient inhabitants had leucas22 annexed to the continent; now the sea surrounds it. zancle,23 too, is said to have been united to italy, until the sea cut off the neighbouring region, and repelled the land with its waves flowing between. nl “should you seek helice and buris,24 cities of achaia, you will find them beneath the waves, and the sailors are still won't to point out these levelled towns, with their walls buried under water. nl “there is a high hill near trœzen of pittheus, without any trees, once a very level surface of a plain, but now a hill; for (frightful to tell) the raging power25 of the winds, pent up in dark caverns, desiring to find some vent and having long struggled in vain to enjoy a freer air, as there was no opening in all their prison and it was not pervious to their blasts, swelled out the extended earth, just as the breath of the mouth is won't to inflate a bladder, or the hide26 stripped from the two-horned goat. that swelling remained on the spot, and still preserves the appearance of a high hill, and has grown hard in length of time. though many other instances may occur, either heard of by, or known to, yourselves, yet i will mention a few more. and besides, does not water, as well, both produce and receive new forms? in the middle of the day, thy waters, horned ammon,27 are frozen, at the rising and at the setting of the sun they are warm. on applying its waters, athamanis28 is said to kindle wood when the waning moon has shrunk into her smallest orb. the ciconians have a river,29 which when drunk of, turns the entrails into stone, and lays a covering of marble on things that are touched by it. the crathis30 and the sybaris adjacent to it, in our own country, make the hair similar in hue to amber and gold. nl “and, what is still more wonderful, there are some streams which are able to change, not only bodies, but even the mind. by whom has not salmacis,31 with its obscene waters, been heard of? who has not heard, too, of that lake of æthiopia,32 of which, if any body drinks with his mouth, he either becomes mad, or falls into a sleep wondrous for its heaviness? whoever quenches his thirst from the clitorian spring33 hates wine, and in his sobriety takes pleasure in pure water. whether it is that there is a virtue in the water, the opposite of heating wine, or whether, as the natives tell us, after the son of amithaon,34 by his charms and his herbs, had delivered the raving daughters of prœtus from the furies, he threw the medicines for the mind in that stream; and a hatred of wine remained in those waters. nl “the river lyncestis35 flows unlike that stream in its effect; for as soon as any one has drunk of it with immoderate throat, he reels, just as if he had been drinking unmixed wine. there is a place in arcadia, (the ancients called it pheneos,)36 suspicious for the twofold nature of its water. stand in dread of it at night; if drunk of in the night time, it is injurious; in the daytime, it is drunk of without any ill effects. so lakes and rivers have, some, one property, and some another. there was a time when ortygia37 was floating on the waves, now it is fixed. the argo dreaded the symplegades tossed by the assaults of the waves dashing against them; they now stand immoveable, and resist the attacks of the winds. nl “nor will ætna, which burns with its sulphureous furnaces, always be a fiery mountain; nor yet was it always fiery. for, if the earth is an animal, and is alive, and has lungs that breathe forth flames in many a place, it may change the passages for its breathing, and oft as it is moved, may close these caverns and open others; or if the light winds are shut up in its lowermost caverns, and strike rocks against rocks, and matter that contains the elements of flame, and it takes fire at the concussion, the winds once calmed, the caverns will become cool; or, if the bituminous qualities take fire, or yellow sulphur is being dried up with a smouldering smoke, still, when the earth shall no longer give food and unctuous fuel to the flame, its energies being exhausted in length of time, and when nutriment shall be wanting to its devouring nature, it will not be able to endure hunger, and left destitute, it will desert its flames. nl “the story is, that in the far northern pallene38 there are persons, who are won't to have their bodies covered with light feathers, when they have nine times entered the tritonian lake. for my part i do not believe it; but the scythian women, as well, having their limbs sprinkled with poison, are said to employ the same arts. but if we are to give any credit39 to things proved by experience, do you not see that whatever bodies are consumed by length of time, or by dissolving heat, are changed into small animals? come too, bury some choice bullocks just slain, it is a thing well ascertained by experience, that flower-gathering bees are produced promiscuously from the putrefying entrails. these, after the manner of their producers, inhabit the fields, delight in toil, and labour in hope. the warlike steed,40 buried in the ground, is the source of the hornet. if you take off the bending claws from the crab of the sea-shore, and bury the rest in the earth, a scorpion will come forth from the part so buried, and will threaten with its crooked tail. nl “the silkworms, too, that are won't to cover the leaves with their white threads, a thing observable by husbandmen, change their forms into that of the deadly moth.41 mud contains seed that generate green frogs; and it produces them deprived of feet;42 soon it gives them legs adapted for swimming; and that the same may be fitted for long leaps, the length of the hinder ones exceeds that of the fore legs. and it is not a cub43 which the bear produces at the moment of birth, but a mass of flesh hardly alive. by licking, the mother forms it into limbs, and brings it into a shape, such as she herself has. do you not see, that the offspring of the honey bees, which the hexagonal cell conceals, are produced without limbs, and that they assume both feet and wings only after a time. unless he knew it was the case, could any one suppose it possible that the bird of juno, which carries stars on its tail, and the eagle, the armour-bearer of jove, and the doves of cytherea, and all the race of birds, are produced from the middle portion of an egg? there are some who believe that human marrow changes into a serpent,44 when the spine has putrefied in the enclosed sepulchre. nl “but these which i have named derive their origin from other particulars; there is one bird which renews and reproduces itself. the assyrians call it the phœnix. it lives not on corn or grass, but on drops of frankincense, and the juices of the amomum. this bird, when it has completed the five ages of its life, with its talons and its crooked beak constructs for itself a nest in the branches of a holm-oak, or on the top of a quivering palm. as soon as it has strewed in this cassia and ears of sweet spikenard and bruised cinnamon with yellow myrrh, it lays itself down on it, and finishes its life in the midst of odours. they say that thence, from the body of its parent, is reproduced a little phœnix, which is destined to live as many years. when time has given it strength, and it is able to bear the weight, it lightens the branches of the lofty tree of the burden of the nest, and dutifully carries both its own cradle and the sepulchre of its parent; and, having reached the city of hyperion through the yielding air, it lays it down before the sacred doors in the temple of hyperion. nl “and if there is any wondrous novelty in these things, still more may we be surprised that the hyæna changes its sex,45 and that the one which has just now, as a female, submitted to the embrace of the male, is now become a male itself. that animal, too, which feeds upon46 the winds and the air, immediately assumes, from its contact, any colour whatever. conquered india presented her lynxes to bacchus crowned with clusters; and, as they tell, whatever the bladder of these discharges is changed into stone,47 and hardens by contact with the air. so coral, too, as soon as it has come up to the air becomes hard; beneath the waves it was a soft plant.48 “the day will fail me, and phœbus will bathe his panting steeds in the deep sea, before i can embrace in my discourse all things that are changed into new forms. so in lapse of time, we see nations change, and these gaining strength, while those are falling. so troy was great, both in her riches and her men, and for ten years could afford so much blood; whereas, now laid low, she only shows her ancient ruins, and, instead of her wealth, she points at the tombs of her ancestors. sparta was famed;49 great mycenæ flourished; so, too, the citadel of cecrops, and that of amphion. now sparta is a contemptible spot; lofty mycenæ is laid low. what now is thebes, the city of œdipus, but a mere story? what remains of athens, the city of pandion, but its name? nl “now, too, there is a report that dardanian rome is rising; which, close to the waters of tiber that rises in the apennines, is laying the foundations of her greatness beneath a vast structure. she then, in her growth, is changing her form, and will one day be the mistress of the boundless earth. so they say that the soothsayers, and the oracles, revealers of destiny, declare; and, so far as i recollect, helenus, the son of priam, said to æneas, as he was lamenting, and in doubt as to his safety, when now the trojan state was sinking, ‘son of a goddess, if thou dost thyself well understand the presentiment of my mind, troy shall not, thou being preserved, entirely fall. the flames and the sword shall afford thee a passage. thou shalt go, and, together with thee, thou shalt bear ruined pergamus; until a foreign soil, more friendly than thy native land, shall be the lot of troy and thyself. even now do i see that our phrygian posterity are destined to build a city, so great as neither now exists, nor will exist, nor has been seen in former times. through a long lapse of ages, other distinguished men shall make it powerful, but one born50 of the blood of iülus shall make it the mistress of the world. after the earth shall have enjoyed his presence, the æthereal abodes shall gain him, and heaven shall be his destination.’ remembering it, i call to mind that helenus prophesied this to æneas, who bore the penates from troy; and i rejoice that my kindred walls are rising apace, and that to such good purpose for the phrygians the pelasgians conquered. nl “but that we may not range afar with steeds that forget to hasten to the goal; the heavens, and whatever there is beneath them, and the earth, and whatever is upon it, change their form. we too, who are a portion of the universe, (since we are not only bodies, but are fleeting souls as well, and can enter into beasts as our abode, and be hidden within the breasts of the cattle), should allow those bodies which may contain the souls of our parents, or of our brothers, or of those allied with us by some tie, or of men at all events, to be safe and unmolested; and we ought not to fill51 our entrails with victuals fit for thyestes. how greatly he disgraces himself, how in his impiety does he prepare himself for shedding human blood, who cuts the throat of the calf with the knife, and gives a deaf ear to its lowings! or who can kill the kid as it sends forth cries like those of a child; or who can feed upon the bird to which he himself has given food. how much is there wanting in these instances for downright criminality? a short step only is there thence to it! nl “let the bull plough, or let it owe its death to aged years; let the sheep furnish us a defence against the shivering boreas; let the well-fed she-goats afford their udders to be pressed by the hand. away with your nets, and your springes and snares and treacherous contrivances; deceive not the bird with the bird-limed twig; deceive not the deer with the dreaded feather foils;52 and do not conceal the barbed hooks in the deceitful bait. ifa any thing is noxious, destroy it, but even then only destroy it. let your appetites abstain from it for food, and let them consume a more befitting sustenance.” nl footnotes: nl 8. and its rulers.]—ver. 61. pythagoras is said to have fled from the tyranny of polycrates, the king of samos. nl 9. no good adviser.]—ver. 103. clarke translates ‘non utilis auctor,’ ‘some good-for-nothing introducer.’ nl 10. the goat is led.]—ver 114. see the fasti, book i. l. 361. nl 11. was euphorbus.]—ver. 161. diogenes laërtius, in the life of pythagoras, says that pythagoras affirmed, that he was, first, æthalides;

2,Sound Quelle,Melancholy Strings,"                   apology for raimond sebond nl learning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment; and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding; but learning yet i do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do, as herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein places the sovereign good, and maintained ""that it was only in her to render us wise and contented,"" which i do not believe; no more than i do what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required a very long interpretation. my house has long-been open to men of knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which francis the first embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. for my part i love them well, but i do not adore them. amongst others, peter bunel, a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others of his sort, staid some days at montaigne in my father's company, he presented him at his departure with a book, entitled theologia naturalis; sive liber creaturarum, magistri raimondi de sebonde. and as the italian and spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of spanish with latin terminations, he hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it, and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel doctrines of luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger our ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the reverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke: nl            nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum; nl            ""for with most eagerness they spurn the law, nl           by which they were before most kept in awe;"" nl resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent. nl it happened that my father, a little before his death, having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers, commanded me to translate it for him into french. it is good too translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter itself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom. it was a strange and a new undertaking for me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, i did it as well as i could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed, which after his death was done. nl i found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many people take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom we owe the most service, i have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it. his design is bold and daring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish and make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the christian religion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful that i do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, i believe he has been equalled by none. this work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and of whom all that we know is that he was a spaniard, practising physic at toulouse about two hundred years ago; i enquired of adrian turnebus, who knew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, ""that he thought it was some abstract drawn from st. thomas d'aquin; for that, in truth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety, was alone capable of such thoughts."" be this as it may, whoever was the author and inventor (and 'tis not reasonable, without greater certainty, to deprive sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts. nl the first thing they reprehend in his work is ""that christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace."" in which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect. this were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, i conceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased the bounty of god to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. and i do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly furnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed, by their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. 'tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion; but, withal, i do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which god has endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. we do not satisfy ourselves with serving god with our souls and understandings only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our limbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge. if it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover, by human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and yet, i am afraid, we only have it by this way. nl if we hold upon god by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon god by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation, human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy: nl                 as a great rock repels the rolling tides, nl             that foam and bark about her marble sides, nl            from its strong bulk nl if we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear throughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light. we ought to be ashamed that, in all the human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in some measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish christians by the name! will you see the proof of this? compare our manners to those of a mahometan or pagan, you will still find that we fall very nl short; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others: and that it should be said of us, ""are they so just, so charitable, so good: then they are christians."" all other signs are common to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance, nl martyrs. the peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product of truth. for this our good st. louis was in the right, who, when the tartar king, who was become christian, designed to come to lyons to kiss the pope's feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put him out of conceit with so holy a belief! and yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other, who, going to rome, to the same end, and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so vicious hands. if we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove mountains from their places, saith the sacred word; our actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be merely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well as our belief: brevis est institutio vit honest beauque, si credos. ""believe, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one."" some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe. we think it strange if, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is because we bring nothing to it but our own. justice, which is in one party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed, pretended, but 'tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection of the party. god owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion; not to our passions. men there are the conductors, and therein serve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary. observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so direct and firm. when and where was this more manifest than in france in our days? they who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken it on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with a progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. did one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more united, and more the same? do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them, accord—as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms. nl this so solemn proposition, ""whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,"" do you remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? and hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that. we condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does france than say it? let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the army, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d'armes. whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions, and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run full speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness, and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations, according to the variety wherein they move? nl i evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions. nl there hostility so admirable as the christian. our zeal performs wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition, avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair, towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor toot. our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens, nourishes, and incites them. we must not mock god. if we believed in him, i do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say (and i speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions, we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him;—at least, he would go equal in our affection with riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. the best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his kinsman, or his master. is there any understanding so weak that, having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other (in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory, would change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps, the very desire to offend. the philosopher antisthenes, as he was being initiated in the mysteries of orpheus, the priest telling him, ""that those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death,""—""if thou believest that,"" answered he, ""why dost thou not die thyself?"" diogenes, more rudely, according to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest that in like manner preached to him, ""to become of his religion, that he might obtain the happiness of the other world;—""what!"" said he, ""thou wouldest have me to believe that agesilaus and epaminondas, who were so great men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and canst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?"" did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should not have death in so great horror: nl           non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur; nl           sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais, nl          gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus. nl           ""we should not on a death bed grieve to be nl            dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully nl           from our old hut, and with the snake, be glad nl            to cast off the corrupted slough we had; nl           or with th' old stag rejoice to be now clear nl            from the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear."" nl ""i desire to be dissolved,"" we should say, ""and to be with jesus christ"" the force of plato's arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for. nl all this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other religions are received. either we are happened in the country where it is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority of the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. these considerations ought, 'tis true, to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. another religion, other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way, imprint a quite contrary belief. we are christians by the same title that we are perigordians or germans. and what plato says, ""that there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,"" does not concern a true christian: 'tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation. what kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us? a pleasant faith, that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! can a vicious passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product in our souls? ""they are confident in their judgment,"" says he, ""that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!"" and by reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his laws all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. they say of bion that, infected with the atheism of theodoras, he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of bion. plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of god either by reason or by force. atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous, difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how arrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have, nevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples. a doctrine seriously digested is one thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy. miserable and senseless men, who strive to be worse than they can! nl the error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this great soul of plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into this other mistake, ""that children and old men were most susceptible of religion,"" as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness. the knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our reasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint, having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority of god and his divine grace. now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith, 'tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design. neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them. he has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his divinity, and 'tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it. 'tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, ""that he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible."" sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker. it were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the universe consent to our belief. the heavens, the earth, the elements, our bodies and our souls,—all things concur to this; we have but to find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable of instruction. for this world is a sacred temple, into which man is introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal hand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the sun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are intelligible to us. ""the invisible tilings of god,"" says st. paul, ""appear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works."" nl           and god himself envies not men the grace nl           of seeing and admiring heaven's face; nl            but, rolling it about, he still anew nl            presents its varied splendour to our view, nl           and on oar minds himself inculcates, so nl            that we th' almighty mover well may know: nl          instructing us by seeing him the cause nl             of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws."" nl now our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter. the grace of god is the form; 'tis that which gives fashion and value to it. as the virtuous actions of socrates and cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses; they have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and without light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. faith coming to tinct and illustrate sehond's arguments renders them firm and stolid; and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and of being the first guides to an elementary christian to put him into the way of this knowledge. they in some measure form him to, and render him capable of, the grace of god, by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief. i know a man of authority, bred up to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by sebond's arguments. and should they be stripped of this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith, and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion, they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents: nl            si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer: nl                ""if you have arguments more fit. nl             produce them, or to these submit."" nl let them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others, and upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. i am, unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which i proposed to make answer in the behalf of sebond. some say that his arguments are weak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great ease to confute them. these are to be a little more roughly handled, for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. to an atheist all writings tend to atheism: he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom. these have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish sebond's reasons. as to the rest, they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of authority and command, they durst not attack. the means that i shall use, and that i think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the divine majesty. 'tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon:  ""god permits not any being but himself to be truly wise."" let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem dal gratiam. ""god resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."" ""understanding is in the gods,"" says plato, ""and not at all, or very little, in men."" now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted. let us see, then, if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of sebond; that is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason. for st. augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to reproach them with injustice, ""in that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish."" and to show that a great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition. we must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the weakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all one; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its authority and reject its mediation. nl what does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy, when she so often inculcates to us, ""that our wisdom is but folly in the sight of god: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man, who is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and deceive himself."" these sentences of the holy spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which i would maintain that i should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself. nl let us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance, armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his being. let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. let him make me understand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch, the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head, the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience? can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of the world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole? and the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world; who, i wonder, sealed him this patent? let us see his commission for this great employment was it granted in favour of the wise only? few people will be concerned in it. are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst part of the world, to be preferred before the rest? shall we believe this man?—""for whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world was made? for theirs who have the use of reason: these are gods and men, than whom certainly nothing can be better:"" we can never sufficiently decry the impudence of this conjunction. but, wretched creature, what has he in himself worthy of such an advantage?

""what contrivance, what tools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous a work?"" why do we deprive them of soul, of life, and discourse? have we discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who have no commerce with them but by obedience? shall we say that we have discovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul? what! have we seen any thing like the sun? does he cease to be, because we have seen nothing like him? and do his motions cease, because there are no other like them? if what we have not seen is not, our knowledge is marvellously contracted: qu sunt tant animi angusti! ""how narrow are our understandings!"" are they not dreams of human vanity, to make the moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as plato and plutarch have done? and of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? ""amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of erring, but from a love of error. nl the corruptible body stupifies the soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination."" nl presumption is our natural and original disease. the most wretched and frail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. he feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens under his feet. 'tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to god, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to them portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit how does he know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal motions of animals?—from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? when i play with my cat who knows whether i do not make her more sport than she makes me? we mutually divert one another with our play. if i have my hour to begin or to refus, she also has hers. plato, in his picture of the golden age under saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had, his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life more happily than we could do. need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts? this great author was of opinion that nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time. the defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be in our part as well as theirs? 'tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another,—for we understand them no more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them. 'tis no great wonder if we understand not them, when we do not understand a basque or a troglodyte. and yet some have boasted that they understood them, as apollonius tyanaus, melampus, tiresias, thales, and others. and seeing, as cusmographers report, that there are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions. we must observe the parity betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so have beasts of ours,—much about the same. they caress us, threaten us, and beg of us, and we do the same to them. nl as to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds: nl               ""the tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes. nl           though we of higher race conclude them mutes. nl           yet utter dissonant and various notes, nl           from gentler lungs or more distended throats, nl            as fear, or grief, or anger, do them move, nl           or as they do approach the joys of love."" nl in one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of another sort of bark he is not afraid. even in the very beasts that have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very motions discover it: nl                 ""as infants who, for want of words, devise nl             expressive motions with their hands and eyes."" nl and why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell stories by signs? of whom i have seen some, by practice, so clever and active that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood. lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat, thank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their eyes: nl                ""even silence in a lover nl           love and passion can discover."" nl what with the hands? we require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, pray, supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, admire, number, confess, repent, fear, express confusion, doubt, instruct, command, incite, encourage, swear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, abuse, despise, defy, provoke, flatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt, entertain, congratulate, complain, grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and what not! and all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating speech. nl with the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the lie, welcome, honour, reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject, caress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire. nl what with the eyebrows?—what with the shoulders! there is not a motion that does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline, and a public language that every one understands: whence it should follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that these should rather be judged the property of human nature. i omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need;—the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations that pliny reports have no other language. an ambassador of the city of abdera, after a long conference with agis, king of sparta, demanded of him, ""well, sir, what answer must i return to my fellow-citizens?"" ""that i have given thee leave,"" said he, ""to say what thou wouldest, and as much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word."" is not this a silent speaking, and very easy to be understood? nl as to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals? is there a polity better ordered, the offices better distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that of bees? can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation? nl               ""hence to the bee some sages have assign'd nl            some portion of the god and heavenly wind."" nl the swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? and in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a right angle, without knowing their properties and effects? do they bring water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted? do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy? do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another? why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not deliberation, thought, and conclusion? we sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to imitate them. we see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why do we not conclude the same of them? nl why should we attribute to i know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art? wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of understanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our divine intelligence can do. really, at this rate, we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity is not so irregular and unformed. nl nature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being. for the common complaints i hear men make (as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds, and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks, bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk, according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons, teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and sing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing but weep, without teaching; nl                ""like to the wretched mariner, when toss'd nl          by raging seas upon the desert coast, nl           the tender babe lies naked on the earth, nl          of all supports of life stript by his birth; nl          when nature first presents him to the day, nl          freed from the cell wherein before he lay, nl            he fills the ambient air with doleful cries. nl           foretelling thus life's future miseries;

nl            and need no arms nor walls their goods to save, nl             since earth and liberal nature ever have, nl           and will, in all abundance, still produce nl          all things whereof they can have need or use:"" nl these complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation. our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes. our ancient gauls were but slenderly clad, any more than the irish, our neighbours, though in so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head, according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us, and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always open, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes half-bare as low as the navel. neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary; and the lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. as to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without instruction; nl ""for every one soon finds his natural force. nl which he, or better may employ, or worse."" nl who doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself, may make shift to find something to eat and the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture and artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts, witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year. the late discovered nations, so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery, may give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that, without tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present, now that we have added our own industry: nl                  ""the earth did first spontaneously afford nl            choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board; nl            with herbs and flow'rs unsown in verdant fields. nl           but scarce by art so good a harvest yields; nl             though men and oxen mutually have strove, nl            with all their utmost force the soil t' improve,"" nl the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it. nl as to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them. those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. if some beasts surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. and the industry of fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by instinct and natural precept? that it is so, the elephant shows who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs them at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon, when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body, and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered slime, as with a cuirass. why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron? nl as to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary. nevertheless i believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would be an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by. and 'tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals: for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing, calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love, which they do with the voice, other than speech? and why should they not speak to one another? they speak to us, and we to them. in how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us? we converse with them in another sort of language, and use other appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the idiom according to the kind. nl                 ""thus from one swarm of ants some sally out. nl            to spy another's stock or mark its rout."" nl lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter also. and the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according to the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the same kind. aristotle, in proof of this, instances the various calls of partridges, according to the situation of places: nl                  ""and various birds do from their warbling throats nl           at various times, utter quite different notes, nl           and some their hoarse songs with the seasons change."" nl but it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance. if a man will allege to me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf speak not, i answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others. nl all this i have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things, and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. we are neither above nor below the rest all that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and one fortune: nl                ""all things remain nl           bound and entangled in one fatal chain."" nl there is, indeed, some difference,—there are several orders and degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature: nl               ""all things by their own rites proceed, and draw nl          towards their ends, by nature's certain law."" nl man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity. miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the rail. he is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real pre-eminence. that which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and opinion, has neither body nor taste. and if it be so, that he only, of all the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the false and the true, 'tis an advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him,—sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. i say, then, to return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the same things that we do by our choice and industry. we ought from like effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the same ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. why should we imagine this natural constraint in them, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own. the vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the other animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour, in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very foolishly in my opinion; for i should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those i had begged and obtained from education. it is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of god and nature. nl for instance, take the fox, the people of thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before them to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters' current, and, according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire or advance,—have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid yields to impression! for to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination. we are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them. nl and if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our pleasure, 'tis still but the same advantage we have over one another. nl we have our slaves upon these terms: the climacid, were they not women in syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by which the ladies mounted their coaches? and the greatest part of free persons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being into the power of another. nl the wives and concubines of the thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband's tomb. have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion? some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in death as well as life? whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains. the form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words: ""we swear to suffer ourselves to be chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both body and soul in his service."" nl                  uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro nl            corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca. nl                 ""wound me with steel, or burn my head with fire. nl             or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire."" nl this was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand entered into it, to their destruction. when the scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines, his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of his chamber, and his cook. and upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb. the men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and dogs withal. to what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these? i do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts. diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem, him from servitude: ""they are fools,"" said he; ""'tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me."" and they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. and withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of courage. as we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to the chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks upon blackbirds and larks: nl                 ""the stork with snakes and lizards from the wood nl             and pathless wilds supports her callow brood, nl            while jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood, nl           scours the wide country for undaunted food; nl             sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away, nl            and feeds her nestlings with the generous prey."" nl we divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with our hawks and hounds. and about amphipolis, in thrace, the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. as also along the lake motis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in pieces. and as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook, there is also the like amongst other animals. aristotle says that the cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she extends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it. nl as to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man. we need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate sylla's dictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm! nl why should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody. when we see the goats of candia, when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper, immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies, and those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters too (witness the elephant of king porus whom alexander defeated), the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient;—why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason? for to allege, to their disparagement, that 'tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress. chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and, after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog: ""i have traced my master to this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;"" and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. this sally, purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and the right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from trapezuntius? nl animals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our method. we teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they have a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn. everybody, i believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word. but i observe this effect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common, in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: i have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even there where they have sufficient room to pass; i have seen them, by the trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only to keep their masters further from the ditch;—how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master's safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? and how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man? can all this be apprehended without ratiocination! nl i must not omit what plutarch says he saw of a dog at rome with the emperor vespasian, the father, at the theatre of marcellus. this dog served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages, and had therein his part. he had, amongst other things, to counterfeit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat after he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken giddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators. nl the oxen that served in the royal gardens of susa, to water them, and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which buckets were fastened (such as there are many in languedoc), being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and stand still. we are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all. nl there is more understanding required in the teaching of' others than in being taught. now, setting aside what democritus held and proved, ""that most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,"" as by the spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and nightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:—aristotle is of opinion ""that the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time and care in it;"" whence it happens that those we bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild, it is not all and every one alike—every one has learnt to do better or worse, according to their capacity. and so jealous are they one of another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place, the breath rather failing than the voice. the younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens to the master's lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher. "" have formerly seen,"" says arrian, ""an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him, rising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by the instrument; and 'twas delightful to hear this harmony."" in the spectacles of rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn. and some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters. nl but this other story of the pie, of which we have plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange. she lived in a barber's shop at rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. it happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop. after that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and melancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing. but they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops, and changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before. nl i will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same plutarch (i am sadly confounding all order, but i do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which plutarch says he saw on board a ship. this dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it. nl what is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity! 'tis said that the ravens of barbary do the same, when the water they would drink is too low. this action is somewhat akin to what juba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: ""that when, by the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out."" but this animal, in several other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should i particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, i should easily have what i usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man. the keeper of an elephant in a private house of syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance. nl one day his master would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him. nl and another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner, and filled it with ashes. these are particular effects: but that which all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the armies of the levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants, with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in a day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history); nl                   ""the sires of these huge animals were wont nl           the carthaginian hannibal to mount; nl           our leaders also did these beasts bestride, nl            and mounted thus pyrrhus his foes defied; nl            nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear nl          castles with armed cohorts to the war."" nl they must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to spoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another. they had the charge not of one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in the battle: as the spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil; and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion required; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as they did ardour and fierceness. nl we more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation. i had not else so long insisted upon these examples: for i believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. 'tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past. i have formerly seen men, brought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit, being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages and brutes! who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute, ignorant of the french tongue, ignorant of our salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example. all that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. the same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. they have several conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves, what know we what to make of them! the horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds, and most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did crassus's lamprey, and came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the lake arethusa; and i have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them. nl               ""they every one have names, and one and all nl          straightway appear at their own master's call:"" nl we may judge of that. we may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms, and, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in meditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their own motion; without instruction or precept but because we do not see any such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. as we discern something in this action which the philosopher cleanthes took notice of, because it something resembles our own. he saw, he says, ""ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so made two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation. in the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid upon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others."" this was the interpretation that cleanthes gave of this transaction, giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication, whereof 'tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. but they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it. many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that antony lost to augustus, his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the latins call remora, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself. and the emperor caligula, sailing with a great navy upon the coast of romania, his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish); and was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had without. a citizen of cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen observing, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow. the camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases, according to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or from what he has a design to seize: in the camlon 'tis a passive, but in the polypus 'tis an active, change. we have some changes of colour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the camlon. it is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow, but 'tis not in the power of our own will. now these effects that we discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as 'tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no appearances have arrived at us. nl amongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. that rule and order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by whom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. that it is so, the cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that if one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. this is a miraculous force; but 'tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it, and makes use on't; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. cranes, swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty, and put it in use. huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus, take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings back will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. by which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have. nl the manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting, moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason. for the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of the beasts' manners and way of living; for this saying (out of plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: ""keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast."" nl the chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end; nevertheless, we are ordered by lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual:— nl                 more ferarum, nl          quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur nl           concipere uxores: nl            quia sic loca sumere possunt, nl            pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis; nl and the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex:— nl                  nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt, nl            clunibus ipsa viri venerem si lta retractet, nl            atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua. nl            ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque nl           vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum. nl if it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that serve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air of our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young. and as to friendship, they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have. king lysimachus's dog, hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed, obstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was consumed, as also did the dog of one pyrrhus, for he would not stir from off his master's bed from the time he died; and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his master's body. there are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts are as capable as we. we see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour. animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice. nl desires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither natural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of men; they are all superfluous and artificial. for 'tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. the stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day. the delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites:— nl                   neque ilia nl             magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum. nl                  ""nature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims nl            the pride of titles, and the pomp of names."" nl these irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the natural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own. animals are much more regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches. and as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was rival to aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench in the city of alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her. he would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel her breasts. they tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless glaucia, in the town of asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women. we see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind. oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:— nl                   nec habetur turpe juvenc nl            ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux; nl            quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus nl             semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales. nl                 ""the heifer thinks it not a shame to take nl           her lusty sire upon her willing back: nl            the horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not nl            t' increase the herd by those they have begot; nl          and birds of all sorts do in common live, nl          and by the seed they have conceived conceive."" nl and for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher thales's mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased to practise that device. there are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though they never make any use of it at all. as to thrift, they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto. the ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. but the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting to germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout. nl as to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions, i would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not. nl                   quando leoni fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam nl            expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri? nl                  ""no lion drinks a weaker lion's gore, nl             no boar expires beneath a stronger boar."" nl yet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of bees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:— nl             spe duobus regibus incessit magno discordia motu; nl            continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello nl            gorda licet long prsciscere. nl                  ""but if contending factions arm the hive, nl            when rival kings in doubtful battle strive, nl            tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare, nl            and palpitating hearts that beat to war."" nl i never read this divine description but that, methinks, i there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. for these warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise and horror, this rattle of guns, drums, and cries, nl                fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum nl            re renidescit tellus, subterque virm vi nl             excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes nl             icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

the envy of one single man, a despite, a pleasure, a domestic jealousy, causes that ought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all this mighty bustle. shall we believe those very men who are themselves the principal authors of these mischiefs? let us then hear the greatest, the most powerful, the most victorious emperor that ever was, turning into a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles fought both by sea and land, the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men that followed his fortune, and the strength and riches of two parts of the world drained for the expense of his expeditions:— nl                  quod futuit glaphyran antonius, hanc mihi poenam nl            fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam. nl            fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me manius oret nl            podicem, faciam? non puto, si sapiam. nl           aut futue, aut pugnemus, ait nl            quid, si mihi vitii nl           charior est ips mentula? signa canant. nl                   qui? moi, que je serve fulvie! nl           sufflt-il quelle en ait envie? nl            a ce compte, on verrait se retirer von moi nl            mille pouses mal satisfaites. nl          aime-moi, me dit elle, ou combattons. mais quoi? nl            elle est bien laide! allons, sonnes trompettes. nl            'cause anthony is fired with glaphire's charms nl           fain would his fulvia tempt me to her arms. nl           if anthony be false, what then? must i nl            be slave to fulvia's lustful tyranny? nl             then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives, nl (i use my latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow me.) now this great body, with so many fronts, and so many motions, which seems to threaten heaven and earth:— nl                 quam multi lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus, nl            svus ubi orion hibemis conditur undis, nl             vel quam solo novo dens torrentur arist, nl             aut hermi campo, aut lyci flaventibus arvis;

for it was he, as i take it, that sertorious beat in spain with those fine arms, which also served eumenes against antigonus, and surena against crassus:— nl                  ""swarm to my bed like bees into their hives. nl           declare for love, or war, she said;

and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one. the souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings. the same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province. they are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more. in a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same. nl as to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man. our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters. king pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead man's body, and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office, commanded that the body should be buried, and took the dog along with him. one day, as he was at a general muster of his army, this dog, seeing his master's murderers, with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after perfected by form of justice. as much was done by the dog of the wise hesiod, who convicted the sons of ganictor of naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master. another dog being to guard a temple at athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke, kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place. the news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and at last found him in the city of cromyon, and the thief also, whom they brought back to athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in consideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn for the dog's daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to take care of it. plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived. nl as to gratitude (for i think we need bring this word into a little repute), this one example, which apion reports himself to have been an eye-witness of, shall suffice. nl ""one day,"" says he, ""at rome, they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious deportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud and dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one androdus, of dacia, belonging to a roman lord of consular dignity. this lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him. this being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch, who was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. at which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave to be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story: ""my master,"" said he, ""being pro-consul in africa, i was constrained, by his severity and cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and, to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province, i thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and uninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill myself. the sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat intolerable, i lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went into it soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded and bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. at his coming i was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. i then drew out a great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best i could. he, finding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. from that time forward he and i lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces, which i roasted in the sun for want of fire, and so ate it. at last, growing weary of this wild and brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision, i departed thence, and the third day after was taken by the soldiers, who brought me from africa to this city to my master, who presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts. now, by what i see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands."" this is the story that androdus told the emperor, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the lion was, by order of the people, presented to him. ""we afterwards saw,"" says apion, ""androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash, from tavern to tavern at rome, and receiving what money every body would give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him saying, 'there goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the man that cured the lion.'"" nl we often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of us:— nl                  post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, thon nl           it lacrymans, guttisque humectt grandibus ora. nl                  ""to close the pomp, thon, the steed of state. nl             is led, the fun'ral of his lord to wait. nl           stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace nl           he walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face."" nl as some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better kept than ours? as to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the cry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence? the fish scarus, when he has swallowed the angler's hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out. nl mullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut and saw it asunder. as to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life, there are several like examples amongst them. 'tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires into it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm; which plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of anticyra. there is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile. the wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach to fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger. nl he feeds of this monster's leavings, who receives him familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and when he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing it any harm at all. the shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster kind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. in the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics. as to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never stir thence till the next equinox; for which reason aristotle himself attributes to them this science. as to geometry and arithmetic, they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and make up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round with six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth, and the breadth to the length. nl as to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to alexander the great from the indies. they first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself, evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him. touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults, 'tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat, but starved himself to death. and as to clemency, 'tis said of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put in to him, he suffered a two days' hunger rather than hurt it, and the third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, and as to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation, it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame together. nl but that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the sicilian sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth? the poets indeed say that one only island, delos, which was before a floating island, was fixed for the service of latona's lying-in; but god has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed, made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst the halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the shortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger. their females never have to do with any other male but their own, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking him. if he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death. but the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials. plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done, and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky, that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. and that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within, which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so much as the water of the sea. this is a very dear description of this building, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture. now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon, and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend? nl to pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of things she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition; as rome and paris, for example, that i have in my fancy, paris that i imagine, i imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without wood; this very same privilege, i say, seems evidently to be in beasts; for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter, as if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and without body:— nl                  quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt nl           in somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque spe, nl             et quasi de palm summas contendere vires: nl                   ""you shall see maneg'd horses in their sleep nl             sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep, nl            as if with all their force they striving were nl             the victor's palm proudly away to bear:"" nl the hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur and without bones:— nl            venantumque canes in molli spe quiete nl           jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente nl          mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras, nl            ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum: nl           expergeftique sequuntur inania spe nl           cervorum simulacra, fag quasi dedita cernant; nl            donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se: nl                ""and hounds stir often in their quiet rest, nl          spending their mouths, as if upon a quest, nl          snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went nl           in a full chase upon a burning scent: nl          nay, being wak'd, imagin'd stags pursue, nl          as if they had them in their real view, nl          till, having shook themselves more broad awake, nl          they do at last discover the mistake:"" nl the watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:— nl                 consueta domi catulorum blanda propago nl             degere, spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem nl            discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant, nl            proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur. nl                  ""the fawning whelps of household curs will rise, nl           and, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes, nl           oft bark and stare at ev'ry one within, nl           as upon faces they had never seen."" nl to the beauty of the body, before i proceed any further i should know whether or no we are agreed about the description. 'tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any natural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat of the fire. but we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking:— nl          turpis romano belgicus ore color: nl          ""a german hue ill suits, a roman face."" nl the indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth, even below the roots. in peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful, which they stretch out as far as they can by art. and a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he did with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of an ear. there are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. the women are reputed more beautiful, not only in biscay, but elsewhere, for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen countries, as pliny reports. the mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders. we should paint deformity so. the italians fashion it gross and massy; the spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has it white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and majestic. just as the preference in beauty that plato attributes to the spherical figure the epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square, and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. but, be it how it will, nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest and if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others, and in greater number, that are more; a multis animalibus decore vincimur ""many animals surpass us in beauty,"" even among the terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the aerial. and this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter of, our erect stature, looking towards heaven our original, nl                   pronaque cum spectent animalia ctera terrain, nl           os homini sublime ddit, columque tueri nl           jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus, nl                 ""whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend nl           their sight, and to their earthly mother tend, nl           he set man's face aloft, that, with his eyes nl           uplifted, he might view the starry skies,"" nl is truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their sight absolutely turned towards heaven; and i find the gesture of camels and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. what animals have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite, as we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man? and what qualities of our bodily constitution, in plato and cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts? those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage, are baboons:— nl           simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis? nl           ""how like to man, in visage and in shape, nl          is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?"" nl as to the internal and vital parts, the hog. in earnest, when i consider man stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, i find that we have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. let us observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind. and really 'tis also an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade prescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of the body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves:— nl                  ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes nl             viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hsit amor. nl              ""the love that's tilting when those parts appear nl          open to view, flags in the hot career,"" nl and, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. it is not modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies so circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are painted and tricked up for the public view:— nl               nec veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ips nl           omnia summopere hos vit postscenia celant, nl          quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore: nl               ""of this our ladies are full well aware, nl          which make them, with such privacy and care, nl          behind the scene all those defects remove, nl          likely to check the flame of those they love,"" nl whereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not love, and that does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our richest ornaments and perfumes. this discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil. nl as to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. we attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent good, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion, as reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend, essential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security, innocence, and health; health, i say, the fairest and richest present that nature can make us. insomuch that philosophy, even the stoic, is so bold as to say, ""that heraclitus and pherecides, could they have trucked their wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had done well."" by which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if circe had presented ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise man, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which circe changed his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner: ""forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass."" how! the philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering? it is then no more by reason, by discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; 'tis by our beauty, our fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must quit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. well, i accept this open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts, upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy. if beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to man, miserable, wicked, mad, man. for, in short, whatever is not as we are is nothing worth; and god, to procure himself an esteem among us, must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. by which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish pride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals, and separate ourselves from their society and condition. nl but to return to what i was upon before; we have for our part inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude of things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice, jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying, disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. doubtless, we have strangely overpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject. unless we shall also think fit, as even socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, that whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons."" ut vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar, nocet sopissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino, quam tam muniice et tam large dari? as it falls out that wine often hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit, so i know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we call reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand."" of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to yarro and aristotle? did it exempt them from human inconveniences? were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter? nl did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout? or, for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less? did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common? on the contrary, having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the romans and the other amongst the greeks, and in a time when learning did most flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular excellence in their lives; nay, the greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his. have we observed that pleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands astrology and grammar than with others? nl             illiterati num minus nervi rigent? nl            ""th' illiterate ploughman is as fit nl             for venus' service as the wit:"" nl or shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last? nl                   scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis, nl            et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vit nl            longa tibi post hc fato meliore dabuntur. nl                    ""disease thy couch shall flee, nl            and sorrow and care; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see nl           long years of happiness, till now unknown."" nl i have known in my time a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser and more happy than the rectors of the university, and whom i had much rather have resembled. learning, methinks, has its place amongst the necessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most, as beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful to it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. we stand very little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition. if man was wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life. whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. old rome seems to me to have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that learned rome that ruined itself. and, though all the rest should be equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. but i will leave this discourse, that would lead me farther than i am willing to follow; and shall only say this further, 'tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man. we are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every man's own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we should at large forge ourselves duties that would, as epicurus says, enjoin us to eat one another. nl the first law that ever god gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it was a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. from obedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from selfopinion. and, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; eritis sicut dii, scientes bonum et malum. ""ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" and the sirens, in homer, to allure ulysses, and draw him within the danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. the plague of man is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and obedience; cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones, secundum elementa mundi. ""take heed, lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world."" there is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it? nl                    ad summum, sapiens uno minor est jove, dives, nl             liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum; nl             prcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est: nl                    ""in short, the wise is only less than jove, nl             rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above nl            all earthly kings; with health supremely blest, nl             excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!"" nl it seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance. 'tis as epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the use of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion. the gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in intelligence. man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his ills in essence. we have reason to magnify the power of our imagination; for all our goods are only in dream. hear this poor calamitous animal huff! ""there is nothing,"" says cicero, ""so charming as the employment of letters; of letters, i say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the immense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth, and the seas are discovered to us; 'tis they that have taught us religion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued our souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first, last, and middling; 'tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and without offence."" does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the ever-living and almighty god? but as to effects, a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than his. nl                  deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte memmi, nl           qui princeps vit rationem invenit earn, qu nl            nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem nl            fluctibus  tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris, nl           in tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit: nl                ""that god, great memmus, was a god no doubt nl          who, prince of life, first found that reason out nl          now wisdom called; and by his art, who did nl          that life in tempests tost, and darkness hid, nl          place in so great a calm, and clear a light:"" nl here are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man's understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd, notwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of democritus's book: ""i am going to speak of all things;"" and that foolish title that aristotle prefixes to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill himself,—eusebius's chronicon. nl of the mortal gods; and the judgment of chrysippus, that ""dion was as virtuous as god;"" and my seneca himself says, that ""god had given him life; but that to live well was his own;"" conformably to this other: in virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum deo, non nobis haberemus: ""we truly glory in our virtue; which would not be, if it was given us of god, and not by ourselves;"" this is also seneca's saying; ""that the wise man hath fortitude equal with god, but that his is in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals god."" there is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself equalled with god, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our creator. nl but we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. so long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his maker; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him to his shirt. let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy: posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour, by crying out against it: ""thou mayst do thy worst, i will not confess that thou art an evil."" he was as sensible of the pain as my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least, and restraining it within the laws of his sect: re succumbere non oportebat, verbis gloriantem. ""it did not become him, that spoke so big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test."" arcesilas being ill of the gout, and car-neades, who had come to see him, going away troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet and breast: ""there is nothing comes thence hither,"" said he. this has something a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be disengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor subdued by it. the other stands more obstinately to his point, but, i fear, rather verbally than really. and dionysius heracleotes, afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions. but even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently?—the philosopher pyrrho, being at sea in very great danger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. philosophy, when she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. what is the cause that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those of a horse, more easily than our own—but ignorance only? how many has mere force of imagination made sick? we often see men cause themselves to be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion.—when real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us her's; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion; this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying, this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture; there must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against yourself. compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations, to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge, and without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is really ill. whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has it in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it. nl what i say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences. thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment my ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear; and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others, and of events i see elsewhere upon the like occasion, i find of all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me. i receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare; so far am i from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living. beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. that which is told us of those of brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but i rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from all passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion. and whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest and dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous performances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. what puts the soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? of what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? as great friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; 'tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other. in the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul. who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue? plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness. great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious, ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other italian poet, to the air of the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences, that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and without soul? i was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see him at ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting both himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before his face, have been published unformed and incorrect. nl would you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a steady and secure posture? muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth. we must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led. and if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does: segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt. we are not so sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness. nl                 pungit nl            in cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus; nl           quando valere nihil quemquam movet. hoc juvat unum, nl          quod me non torquet latus, aut pes; nl          ctera quisquam vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem. nl               ""the body with a little sting is griev'd, nl          when the most perfect health is not perceiv'd, nl          this only pleases me, that spleen nor gout nl          neither offend my side nor wring my foot; nl          excepting these, scarce any one can tell, nl          or e'er observes, when he's in health and well."" nl our well-being is nothing but the not being ill. which is the reason why that sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure, has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. to be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as ennius says,— nl            nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali; nl for that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active, moving, and, i know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. the appetite that carries us headlong to women's embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever. and so of the rest. i say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition. and yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense; for crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of epicurus, if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: ""i do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired. i am very well content not to be sick; but if i am, i would know that i am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, i would feel them."" in truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure, and finally annihilate man himself: istud nihil dolere, non sine magn mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore. ""an insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul, and of stupidity of the body."" evil appertains to man of course. neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always pursued. nl 'tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune. for what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us, and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti, et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates, ponit; ""he directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;"" if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? for not only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking greek wine a month ago? it would rather only make matters worse to him:— nl           che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia. nl            ""the thinking of pleasure doubles trouble."" nl of the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to remember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we have undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power, and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek. nl            suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria. nl            ""sweet is the memory of by-gone pain."" nl how does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? for the memory represents to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it. and 'tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it. and this is false: est situm in nobis, ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus; ""it is in our power to bury, as it were, in a perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes;"" and this is true: memini etiam quo nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo. ""i do also remember what i would not; but i cannot forget what i would."" and whose counsel is this? his, qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus; ""who alone durst profess himself a wise man."" nl                 qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes nl           prstinxit stellas, exortus uti thereus sol. nl                 ""who from mankind the prize of knowledge won, nl          and put the stars out like the rising sun."" nl to empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to ignorance? nl          iners malorum remedium ignorantia est. nl          ""ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils."" nl we find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow frivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest reason will not answer the purpose, provided they administer satisfaction and comfort where they cannot cure the wound, they are content to palliate and benumb it i believe they will not deny this, that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment, they would accept it:— nl                 potare, et spargere flores nl           incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi. nl                ""give me to drink, and, crown'd with flowers, despise nl           the grave disgrace of being thought unwise."" nl there would be a great many philosophers of lycas's mind this man, being otherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his family, and not failing in any office of his duty, either towards his own or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful things, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of the finest sights and the best comedies in the world; and being cured by the physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination:— nl                 pol i me occidistis, amici, nl            non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas, nl            et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error; nl                 ""by heaven! you've killed me, friends, outright, nl           and not preserved me; since my dear delight nl          and pleasing error, by my better sense nl           unhappily return'd, is banished hence;"" nl with a madness like that of thrasylaus the son of pythodorus, who made himself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of pirus, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for his profit; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and receiving them with the greatest joy; and when his brother crito caused him to be restored to his better understanding, he infinitely regretted that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind. 'tis according to the old greek verse, that ""there is a great deal of convenience in not being over-wise."" nl and ecclesiastes, ""in much wisdom there is much sorrow;"" and ""who gets wisdom gets labour and trouble."" nl even that to which philosophy consents in general, that last remedy which she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life we are not able to endure. placet?—pare. non placet?—qucumque vis, exi. pungit dolor?—vel fodiat sane. si nudus es, da jugulum; sin tectus armis vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, rsist; ""does it please?—obey it. not please?—go where thou wilt. does grief prick thee,—nay, stab thee?—if thou art naked, present thy throat; if covered with the arms of vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it."" and this word, so used in the greek festivals, aut bibat, aut abeat, ""either drink or go,"" which sounds better upon the tongue of a gascon, who naturally changes the h into v, than on that of cicero:— nl                vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis. nl          lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti; nl          tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius quo nl            rideat et pulset lasciva decentius tas. nl                ""if to live well and right thou dost not know, nl          give way, and leave thy place to those that do. nl           thou'st eaten, drunk, and play'd to thy content, nl           'tis time to make thy parting compliment, nl           lest youth, more decent in their follies, scoff nl          the nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;"" nl what is it other than a confession of his impotency, and a sending back not only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity, insensibility, and nonentity? nl                democritum postquam matura vetustas nl           admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis; nl           sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse. nl               ""soon as, through age, democritus did find nl            a manifest decadence in his mind, nl            he thought he now surviv'd to his own wrong, nl          and went to meet his death, that stay'd too long."" nl 'tis what antisthenes said, ""that a man should either make provision of sense to understand, or of a halter to hang himself;"" and what chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet tyrtus:— nl          ""or to arrive at virtue or at death;"" nl and crates said, ""that love would be cured by hunger, if not by time; and whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope."" that sextius, of whom both seneca and plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having applied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of philosophy, resolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the progress of his studies too tedious and slow. he ran to find death, since he could not overtake knowledge. these are the words of the law upon the subject: ""if peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no remedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff; for 'tis the fear of dying, and not the love of life, that ties the fool to his body."" nl as life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as i was saying before: ""the simple and ignorant,"" says st. paul, ""raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss."" i am neither swayed by valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by licinius, both roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. such as return from the new world discovered by the spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:— nl                    di cittatorie piene, e di libelli, nl            d'esamine, e di carte di procure, nl            hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli nl           di chioge, di consigli, et di letture: nl           per cui le faculta de* poverelli nl            non sono mai nelle citt sicure; nl             hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati, nl             notai, procuratori, ed avvocati. nl                     ""their bags were full of writs, and of citations, nl             of process, and of actions and arrests, nl             of bills, of answers, and of replications, nl             in courts of delegates, and of requests, nl             to grieve the simple sort with great vexations; nl             they had resorting to them as their guests, nl             attending on their circuit, and their journeys, nl            scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys."" nl it was what a roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as i interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself. nl christians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. pride was his ruin and corruption. 'tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father:  ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us? nl after that socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. he knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. at last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his god considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. the sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: ""dust and ashes,"" says it to such, ""what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?"" and, in another place, ""god has made man like unto a shadow,"" of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! man is a thing of nothing. nl our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. to meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. if it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. melius scitur deus nesdendo: ""god is better known by not knowing him,"" says st. austin: and tacitus, sanctius est ac reverentius de actis deorum credere, quam scire; ""it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of god than to know them;"" and plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into god, the world, and the first causes of things: atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas: ""to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,"" says cicero. we talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. we say that god fears, that god is angry, that god loves, nl            immortalia mortali sermone notantes: nl           ""giving to things immortal mortal names."" nl these are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in god, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. it only belongs to god to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth. how can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? how can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? how justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in god? how temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the divinity? fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. for which reason aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia? ""he can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty."" nl the participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: god has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by__ the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, ""i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world? for after that, in the wisdom of god, the world knew not god, it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."" nl finally, should i examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so many ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; i believe he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness. we have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before. the same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. so men, having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition. 'tis what velleius reproaches cotta withal and cicero, ""that they had learned of philo, that they had learned nothing."" pherecydes, one of the seven sages, writing to thales upon his death-bed; ""i have,"" said he, ""given order to my people, after my interment, to carry my writings to thee. if they please thee and the other sages, publish; if not, suppress them. they contain no certainty with which i myself am satisfied. neither do i pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it. i rather open than discover things."" the wisest man that ever was, being asked what he knew, made answer, ""he knew this, that he knew nothing."" by which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even what we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our ignorance. we know things in dreams, says plato, and are ignorant of them in truth. ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia curricula vito. ""almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses are too limited, men's minds too weak, and the course of life too short."" and of cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, valerius says, ""that he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy."" dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans plerumque, et mihi diffidens. ""something i must say, but so as to affirm nothing; i inquire into all things, but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself."" nl i should have too fair a game should i consider man in his common way of living and in gross; yet i might do it by his own rule, who judges truth not by weight, but by the number of votes. let us set the people aside, nl               qui vigilans stertit,.... nl            mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti; nl                 ""half of his life by lazy sleep's possess'd, nl           and when awake his soul but nods at best;"" nl who neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie idle; i will take man in his highest ground. let us consider him in that little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who, having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have moreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. they have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without the world; 'tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain. they have regulated the world with policies and laws. they have instructed it with arts and sciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. i shall make account of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience. let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. the errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own. nl whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet upon the search. all philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her design is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. the peripatetics, epicureans, stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. these established the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain knowledge. clitomachus, carneades, and the academics, have despaired in their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings. the result of these is weakness and human ignorance. this sect has had the most and the most noble followers. pyrrho, and other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from homer, the seven sages, and from archilochus and euripides, and to whose number these are added, zeno, democritus, and xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth. these conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it; for this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the difficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they doubt whether man is capable:— nl                  nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit, nl            an sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur. nl                ""he that says nothing can be known, o'erthrows nl            his own opinion, for he nothing knows, nl           so knows not that."" nl the ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that the profession of the pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and consentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another, so light as it is. zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: ""an open and expanded hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little bending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge."" now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without application or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a peaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience, obstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after a very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed, and love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment, which is their end. they only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief. if you take their arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; 'tis all one to them, they have no choice. if you maintain that snow is black, they will argue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. if you hold, of certain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they will argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt. and by this extremity of doubt, which jostles itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and ignorance. ""why shall not they be allowed to doubt,"" say they, ""as well as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? can any thing be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous?"" and where others are carried away, either by the custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by accident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay, and for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such an opinion, to the sect whether stoic or epicurean, with which they are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot forsake: ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn, tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt; ""every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest;"" why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? hoc liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas: ""in this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater power of judging."" is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others? is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle one's self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced? is it not much better to suspend one's persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: ""what shall i choose?"" ""what you please, provided you will choose."" a very foolish answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of. nl take the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. is it not better to keep out of this hurly-burly? you are permitted to embrace aristotle's opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life, and to give the lie to plato thereupon, and shall they be interdicted to doubt him? if it be lawful for pantius to maintain his opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the stoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he is a professor and a member? if it be a child that judges, he knows not what it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. they have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of the care of defence. if you strike them, they care not, provided they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. if they overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short, they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that nothing is known, 'tis well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis also well: ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur: ""that when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing, the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended."" and they make account to find out, with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why 'tis true; that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe, than what they do. their way of speaking is: ""i assert nothing; it is no more so than so, or than neither one nor t'other; i understand it not. appearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, pro or con, is the same. nothing seems true, that may not seem false."" their sacramental word is that is to say, ""i hold, i stir not."" this is the burden of their song, and others of like stuff. the effect of which is a pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. they make use of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine. whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever, conceives a true idea of pyrrhonism. i express this fancy as well as i can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely. nl as to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the common fashion. they yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution of laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; non enim nos deus ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit. ""for god would not have us know, but only use those things."" they suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. for which reason i cannot consent to what is said of pyrrho, by those who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and unsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. this is to enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or a stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning, enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason. the fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and renounced. yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if he means to live. and if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances, provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. he has a body, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. and although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience. how many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge; that decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so! there are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. we are much more prudent, in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without inquiry. a soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose. men that judge and control their judges, do never duly submit to them. nl how much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human causes! there is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty, confessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from above, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more room to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a sworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. 'tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of god as he shall please to write upon it. the more we resign and commit ourselves to god, and the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. ""take in good part,"" says ecclesiastes, ""the things that present themselves to thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy knowledge."" dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van sunt: ""the lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity."" nl thus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open profession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the dogmatists, which is the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth: quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt: ""which the learned rather feign than know."" timus, being to instruct socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men, proposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient, if his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of his followers has thus imitated: ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut pythius apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero; sed, ut homunculus, probabilia conjectur sequens: ""i will, as well as i am able, explain; affirming, yet not as the pythian oracle, that what i say is fixed and certain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture."" and this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death; he has elsewhere translated from the very words of plato: si forte, de deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis? ""if perchance, when we discourse of the nature of god, and the world's original, we cannot do it as we desire, it will be no great wonder. for it is just you should remember that both i who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more."" aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men's opinions and beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others; which made epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings. this is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. in earnest, we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice; it is, in effect, a pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. hear cicero's protestation, who expounds to us another's fancy by his own: qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a socrate, repetita ab arcesila, conjirmata a gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota. ""they who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. this practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely concluding nothing, begun by socrates, repeated by arcesilaus, and confirmed by cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. we are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent."" why hath not aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick? clitomachus affirmed ""that he could never discover by carneades's writings what opinion he was of."" this was it that made epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured heraclitus the epithet of  difficulty is a coin the learned make use of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay. nl                  claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes... nl          omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque nl           inversis qu sub verbis latitantia cemunt. nl                 ""bombast and riddle best do puppies please, nl          for fools admire and love such things as these; nl          and a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase, nl           up to the height doth their wise wonder raise."" nl cicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life, and more profitable and proper studies. the cyrenaick philosophers, in like manner, despised physics and logic. zeno, in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use. chrysippus said ""that what plato and aristotle had writ, concerning logic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;"" and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. plutarch says the same of metaphysics. and epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy excepted, of all the sciences; and socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life. whatever any one required to be instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary: parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt. ""that learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue."" most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage. nl as to the rest, some have looked upon plato as a dogmatist, others as a doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other. socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself. homer, their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose. 'tis said that ten several sects sprung from plato; yet, in my opinion, never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not. nl socrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and that by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty of bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that could; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their birth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others. nl it is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the ancients have observed in the writings of anaxagoras, democritus, parmenides, xenophanes, and others. they have a way of writing, doubtful in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods. is not the same thing seen in seneca and plutarch? how many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them! so many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies. it is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously and with greater profit. let us take example from ourselves: judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking; and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people, the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion, which with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit and the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim—""in a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief;"" for, as euripides says,— nl          ""god's various works perplex the thoughts of men."" nl like that which empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and compelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: ""no, no, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;"" according to the divine saying: cogitationes mortalium timid, et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice. ""for the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain."" it is not to be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt after, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures, the stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge. nl democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that ""he need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey."" he was vexed at this discovery, and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon: ""go thy way,"" said he, ""thou hast done me an injury; but, for all that, i will seek out the cause as if it were natural;"" and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect. this story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking. satius est supervacua discere, quam nihil. ""'tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all."" as in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. thus they say: ""the consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing them with those that are celestial and high. the mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it."" this is what they profess. the vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge. ""eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to comprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should thereby be immediately burned."" he would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have acquired. nl i cannot easily persuade myself that epicurus, plato, and pytagoras, have given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. they were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain. but in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though false, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them. unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti vi. ""these things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of knowledge."" nl one of the ancients, who was reproached, ""that he professed philosophy, of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,"" made answer, ""that this was truly to philosophize."" nl they wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity. some things they wrote for the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country. nl plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. when he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his laws, he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. he says very roundly, in his republic, ""that it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them."" it is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their reputation. 'tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life. the boldest sects, as the epicurean, pyrrhonian, and the new academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account. nl there are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some to the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any certain truth, but merely for exercise. non tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse. ""they seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter."" and if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men? as, for example, what can be more vain than to imagine, to guess at god, by our analogies and conjectures? to direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws? and to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity, with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries? nl of all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged god as an incomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all goodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies soever— nl                jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, demque, nl             progenitor, genitrixque. nl                 ""jove, the almighty, author of all things, nl          the father, mother, of both gods and kings."" nl this zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye. all governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. pagan histories acknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; god, through his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. not only deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that st. paul found in repute at athens, that which they had dedicated ""to the unknown god"" seemed to him the most to be excused. nl pythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection, every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity. but if numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use; the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model. the divine majesty has thus, in some sort, suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage. his supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for 'tis man that believes and prays. i shall omit the other arguments upon this subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our saviour's passion, that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the senses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect. nl of those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that universal blindness, i should, i fancy, most incline to those who adored the sun:— nl                la lumire commune, nl           l'oil du monde; et si dieu au chef porte des yeux, nl            les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux, nl             qui donnent vie  touts, nous maintiennent et gardent, nl            et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent: nl           ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons, nl          selon qu'il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;

and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it. nl thales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed god to be a spirit that made all things of water; anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an infinite number of worlds; anaximines, that the air was god, that he was procreate and immense, always moving. anaxagoras the first, was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit. alcmon gave divinity to the sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. pythagoras made god a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by the ardour of light. empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which all things are composed, to be gods; protagoras had nothing to say, whether they were or were not, or what they were; democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods; another while, the nature that darts out those images; and then, our science and intelligence. plato divides his belief into several opinions; he says, in his timus, that the father of the world cannot be named; in his laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and elsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the stars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic. nl xenophon reports a like perplexity in socrates's doctrine; one while that men are not to inquire into the form of god, and presently makes him maintain that the sun is god, and the soul god; that there is but one god, and then that there are many. speusippus, the nephew of plato, makes god a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul. aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one while he gives the world another master, and another while makes god the heat of heaven. zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets; the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. heraclides ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion, and finally deprives god of sense, and makes him shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven and earth. theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. strato says that 'tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation, and diminution, without form and sentiment zeno says 'tis the law of nature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal; and takes away the accustomed gods, jupiter, juno, and vesta. diogenes apolloniates, that 'tis air. zenophanes makes god round, seeing and hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature. aristo thinks the form of god to be incomprehensible, deprives him of sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else; cleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world, another the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and environing all. perseus, zeno's disciple, was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added any notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things themselves. chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes, the men also that have been deified. diagoras and theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all. epicurus makes the gods shining, transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such members as we have; which members are to them of no use:— nl               ego deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum; nl          sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus. nl               ""i ever thought that gods above there were, nl          but do not think they care what men do here."" nl trust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads! the perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me, in comparing them. and all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of god seems to me a choice of very little privilege. the policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our reason. the things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding. i would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties. but to have made gods of our own condition, of whom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to them desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love, jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding; nl               qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant, nl           inque dem numro qu sint indigna videri; nl               ""from divine natures these so distant are, nl          they are unworthy of that character."" nl formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt;

for they are represented to us with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger of the gods;"" as having attributed divinity not only to faith, virtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to voluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:— nl               quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores? nl          o curv in terris anim et colestium inanes! nl                ""o earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led, nl          to every spark of heav'nly influence dead! nl          think ye that what man values will inspire nl          in minds celestial the same base desire?"" nl the egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of hanging, that any one should say that their gods, serapis and isis, had formerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth, signified, says varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them. seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to god, he had done better, says cicero, to have attracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither below, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take it right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like vanity of opinion. nl when philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and power, i cannot believe they speak as they think. when plato describes pluto's orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies, and accommodates them to the feeling we have in this life:— nl                 secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum nl          sylva tegit; cur non ips in morte relinquunt; nl               ""in secret vales and myrtle groves they lie, nl          nor do cares leave them even when they die."" nl when mahomet promises his followers a paradise hung with tapestry, gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with wenches of excelling beauty, rare wines, and delicate dishes; it is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their promises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes and opinions suitable to our mortal appetites. and yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures. can we believe that plato, he who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the divinity as thence to derive the name of the divine plato, ever thought that the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient, to participate of beatitude or eternal pains? we should then tell him from human reason: ""if the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that i have enjoyed here below, this has nothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition, it cannot be of any value. all contentment of mortals is mortal. even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends, if that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences. we cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them; to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable, inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience."" ""eye hath not seen,"" saith st. paul, ""nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things that god hath prepared for them that love him."" and if, to render us capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, plato, sayest, by thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that by physical doctrine it be no more us;— nl                 hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille nl           tractus ab monio non erat hector eqao; nl                he hector was whilst he could fight, but when nl           dragg'd by achilles' steeds, no hector then; nl it must be something else that must receive these recompenses:— nl               quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo; nl          trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant. nl              ""things changed dissolved are, and therefore die; nl          their parts are mix'd, and from their order fly."" nl for in pythagoras's metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of csar is enclosed, does espouse csar's passions, or that the lion is he? for if it was still csar, they would be in the right who, controverting this opinion with plato, reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like absurdities. and can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are not other than their predecessors? from the ashes of a phoenix, a worm, they say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? we see our silk-worms, as it were, die and wither; and from this withered body a butterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this was still the first! that which once has ceased to be is no more:— nl               nec, si materiam nostram collegerit tas nl          post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est, nl          atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit, nl          pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum, nl          interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra. nl               ""neither tho' time should gather and restore nl          our matter to the form it was before, nl          and give again new light to see withal, nl          would that new figure us concern at all; nl          or we again ever the same be seen, nl          our being having interrupted been."" nl and, plato, when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the recompense of another life, thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as little appearance of truth:— nl               scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam nl           dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto; nl               ""no more than eyes once from their optics torn, nl          can ever after any thing discern;"" nl for, by this account, it would no more be man, nor consequently us, who would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two principal essential parts, the separation of which is the death and ruin of our being:— nl               inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque nl          deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes; nl               ""when once that pause of life is come between, nl            'tis just the same as we had never been;"" nl we cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members, and that the earth consumes them:— nl               et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque nl          corporis atque anim consistimus uniter apti. nl              ""what's that to us? for we are only we, nl          while soul and body in one frame agree."" nl moreover, upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice of or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it was themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? and why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their will, they might prevent him from falling? might not epicurus, with great colour of human reason, object this to plato, did he not often save himself with this sentence: ""that it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?"" she does nothing but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things. who does more evidently perceive this than we? for although we have given her certain and infallible principles; and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased god to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this vast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint, and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths. nl man cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity. ""tis a greater presumption,"" says plutarch, ""in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to."" antiquity, i believe, thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties, and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities; offering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances, mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it, and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to our vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as tiberius sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in sardinia for a sacrifice to vulcan; and paulus milius, those of macedonia, to mars and minerva; and alexander, arriving at the indian ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into the sea, in honour of thetes; and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and i believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:— nl                sulmone creatos nl          quatuor hc juvenes, totidem quos educat ufens, nl          viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris. nl               ""four sons of sulmo, four whom ufens bred, nl           he took in flight, and living victims led, nl          to please the ghost of pallas, and expire nl          in sacrifice before his fun'ral pyre."" nl the get hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god zamolxis. every five years they dispatch some one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of. this envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon which the rest throw his body with all their force. if he happen to be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, 'tis held a certain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead. amestris, the mother of xerxes, being grown old, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of persia, to be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify some infernal deity. and even to this day the idols of themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of innocent blood:— nl               tantum religio potuit suadere maloram. nl          ""such impious use was of religion made, nl          so many demon acts it could persuade."" nl the carthaginians immolated their own children to saturn; and those who had none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance. nl it was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions; like the lacedemonians, who regaled their diana with the tormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake, very often to death. it was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that poor iphigenia, at the port of aulis, should by her death and immolation acquit, towards god, the whole army of the greeks from all the crimes they had committed; nl                et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso, nl          hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis; nl               ""that the chaste virgin in her nuptial band nl          should die by an unnat'ral father's hand;"" nl and that the two noble and generous souls of the two decii, the father and the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy: quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo romano non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent? ""how great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of rome unless such men perished!"" to which may be added, that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers. the divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us, both for its justice and for our own penalty. and therefore it was a ridiculous humour of polycrates, tyrant of samos, who, to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly, ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found in the belly of a fish. and then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the corybantes, the menades, and, in our times, of the mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their prophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast, eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat? tantus est perturbto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt. ""so great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve."" the use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us, but also to the service of god and other men; 'tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that are stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason: ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios habere merentur? in regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam; sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit. ""where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate? some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes: but no man at his master's command has put his own hand to unman himself."" so did they fill their religion with several ill effects:— nl          spius olim religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta. nl          ""in elder times religion did commit most fearful crimes."" nl now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto the divine nature, which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection. nl how can that infinite beauty, power, and goodness, admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness? infirmum dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus. ""for the foolishness of god is wiser than men, and the weakness of god is stronger than men."" stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, ""whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?""—""you are indiscreet,"" answered he; ""let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of such things."" nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power besieged by our reasons (i call our ravings and dreams reason, with the dispensation of philosophy, which says, ""that the wicked man, and even the fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason""), we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings,—him who has made both us and our knowledge. because that nothing is made of nothing, god therefore could not make the world without matter. what! has god put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power? is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge? put the case, o man! that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work? thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much; whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. this part is nothing in comparison of the whole:— nl                 omnia cum colo, terrque, manque, nl            nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem. nl                ""the earth, the sea, and skies, from pole to pole, nl            are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole."" nl 'tis a municipal law that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is universal tie thyself to that to which thou art subject, but not him; he is not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. if he has in some sort communicated himself unto thee, 'tis not to debase himself unto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his power; the human body cannot fly to the clouds; rules are for thee. the sun runs every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot preserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. 'tis for thee that he has made these rules; 'tis thee that they concern; he has manifested to christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him. and, in truth, why, almighty as he is, should he have limited his power within any certain bounds? in favour of whom should he have renounced his privilege? thy reason has in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that there is a plurality of worlds:— nl                  terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant, nl            non esse unica, sed numro magis innumerali. nl                   ""that earth, sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are, nl            not single, but innumerable were."" nl the most eminent minds of elder times believed it; and some of this age of ours, compelled by the appearances of human reason, do the same; forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and one, nl           cum in summ res nulla sit una, nl            unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat; nl                 ""since nothing's single in this mighty place, nl            that can alone beget, alone increase;"" nl and that all the kinds are multiplied in some number; by which it seems not to be likely that god should have made this work only without a companion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally drained in this individual. nl                quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est nl            esse alios alibi congressus materiali; nl           qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet ther. nl                ""wherefore 'tis necessary to confess nl           that there must elsewhere be the like congress nl           of the like matter, which the airy space nl           holds fast within its infinite embrace."" nl especially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so credible that plato affirms it, and that many of our people do either confirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient opinion that the heavens, the stars, and other members of the world, are creatures composed of body and soul, mortal in respect of their composition, but immortal by the determination of the creator. now if there be many worlds, as democritus, epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed, what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest? they may peradventure have another form and another polity. epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. we see in this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers; 'tis all there another thing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of bacchus or ceres. if pliny and herodotus are to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal natures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites; where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead, and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the lower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years old, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men have no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject seed of a black colour. what shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? and if it be true, as plutarch says, that in some place of the indies there are men without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours, how many of our descriptions are false? he is no longer risible, nor, perhaps, capable of reason and society. the disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and of no use. nl moreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? and yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto god himself! how many things do we call miraculous, and contrary to nature? this is done by every nation and by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. how many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? for, for us to go ""according to nature,"" is no more but to go ""according to our understanding,"" as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and irregular. now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be assured that snow is white, and anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge or ignorance, which metrodorus of chios denied that man was able to determine; or whether we live, as euripides doubts whether the life we live is life, or whether that we call death be not life,  and not without some appearance. for why do we derive the title of being from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and also a good part of the moment itself. others swear there is no motion at all, as followers of melissus, and that nothing stirs. for if there be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him, nor motion from one place to another, as plato proves: ""that there is neither generation nor corruption in nature."" protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things; nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is more than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty; parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general; that there is but one thing; zeno, that one same is not, and that there is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. according to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false or vain. nl this way of speaking in a christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent. ""god cannot die; god cannot contradict himself; god cannot do this or that."" i do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of men's mouths; and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed. nl our speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes. how many quarrels, and of how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable, hoc,* created in the world? let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself nl             * montaigne here refers to the controversies between nl               the catholics and protestants about transubstantiation. nl presents us withal; if you say, ""it is fine weather,"" and that you say true, it is then fine weather. is not this a very certain form of speaking? and yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow the example: if you say, ""i lie,"" if you say true, you do lie. the art, the reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. the pyrrhonian philosophers, i see, cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for they would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch that when they say ""i doubt,"" they are presently taken by the throat, to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt. by which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison, without which their humour would be inexplicable: when they pronounce, ""i know not,"" or, ""i doubt,"" they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself off with them. this fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation: ""what do i know?"" as i bear it with the emblem of a balance. nl see what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the present disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too hard, they will roundly tell you, ""that it is not in the power of god to make it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in several places at once."" and see, too, what advantage the old scoffer made of this. ""at least,"" says he, ""it is no little consolation to man to see that god cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he cannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had them; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion."" and that the comparison of man to god may yet be made out by jocose examples: ""he cannot order it so,"" says he, ""that twice ten shall not be twenty."" this is what he says, and what a christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips. whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language, to reduce god to their own measure:— nl                 cras vel atr nube polum, pater, occupato, nl           vel sole puro; non tamen irritum nl           quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque nl            diffinget infectumque reddet nl             quod fugiens semel hora vexit. nl                ""to-morrow, let it shine or rain, nl            yet cannot this the past make vain: nl            nor uncreate and render void nl            that which was yesterday enjoyed."" nl when we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but one instant with god; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend it not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must make the divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu. ""'tis wonderful to what the wickedness of man's heart will proceed, if elevated with the least success."" how magisterially and insolently does epicurus reprove the stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to god, and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it! how temerariously have they bound god to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name of a christian shall ever do again)! and thales, plato, and pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity. this arrogance of attempting to discover god with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what happens to us every day, of attributing to god important events, by a particular assignment. because they weigh with us, they conclude that they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course: magna dii curant, parva negligunt: ""the gods are concerned at great matters, but slight the small."" listen to him; he will clear this to you by his reason: nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant: ""neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns."" as if to that king of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea. the hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him. deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit in parvis: ""god is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no less in the least"" our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us. because our employments are a burden to us, strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their priests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world, discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: quod beatum terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri: ""what is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another."" nature will that in like things there should be a like relation. the infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a like number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit. as the souls of the gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of men, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some ecstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the body, they could not see. ""men,"" says st. paul, ""professing themselves to be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man."" do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications. after the great and stately pomp of the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the same time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the soul went into paradise. we have a thousand medals, and particularly of the worthy faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. 'tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions, nl           quod finxere, timent, nl           ""they fear their own inventions,"" nl like children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow, that they themselves have smeared and smutted. quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur: nl ""as if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by his own imagination."" 'tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour him that we have made. augustus had more temples than jupiter, served with as much religion and belief of miracles. the thracians, in return of the benefits they had received from agesilaus, came to bring him word that they had canonized him: ""has your nation,"" said he to them, ""the power to make gods of whom they please? pray first deify some one amongst yourselves, and when i shall see what advantage he has by it, i will thank you for your offer."" man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. hear trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency: ""of all the wonderful things, it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it."" and take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:— nl                nosse cui divos et coli munina soli, nl           aut soli nescire, datum. nl                ""to whom to know the deities of heaven, nl           or know he knows them not, alone 'tis given."" nl ""if there is a god, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature, he has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. if he be without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action; and if he has a body, it is perishable."" is not here a triumph? we are incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work. it were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe. there must then be something that is better, and that must be god. when you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for rats. and this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial palace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor, who is much greater than we? is not the most supreme always the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. the world produces us, the world then has soul and reason. every part of us is less than we. we are part of the world, the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'tis a fine thing to have a great government; the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature. the stars do us no harm; they are then full of goodness. we have need of nourishment; then so have the gods also, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. worldly goods are not goods to god; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; 'tis therefore folly to fear god. god is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more. the divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the first is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we are companions. we have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. in conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. what a pattern, and what a model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:— nl            non, si tu ruperis, inquit. nl           ""not if thou burst,"" said he. nl profecto non deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant? ""certainly they do not imagine god, whom they cannot imagine; but they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but themselves, not to him, but to themselves."" in natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes. what's this to the purpose? his condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote, and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions. 'tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place; our ways lie too low. we are no nearer heaven on the top of mount cenis than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe. they debase god even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times, and so many generations. paulina, the wife of satuminus, a matron of great reputation at rome, thinking she lay with the god serapis, found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the priests of his temple. varro, the most subtle and most learned of all the latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of hercules's temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the other for hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his own. the sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. her name was laurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly reward; which proved to be taruncius, a rich young man, who took her home to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. she, in her turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the people of rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed to her. as if it had not been sufficient that plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had neptune for the common father of his race, it was certainly believed at athens, that aristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair perictione, could not, and was warned by the god apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. these were the father and mother of plato. how many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! and how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! in the mahometan religion there are merlins enough found by the belief of the people; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much in their language. nl we are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions: of all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore god must be of that form. no one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without reason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; god is therefore clothed in a human figure. ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de deo cogitet, forma occurrat hu-mana. ""it is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so prepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of god, a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination."" therefore it was that xenophanes pleasantly said, ""that if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as 'tis likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and glorify themselves in it, as we do. for why may not a goose say thus; ""all the parts of the universe i have an interest in; the earth serves me to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; i have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me; i am the darling of nature! is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me? 'tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the same by his fellow-men, and so do i the worms that kill and devour him."" as much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the account of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high and beautiful region. tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa natura. ""so flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself."" nl now by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us; ''tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims. look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man. she does not allow them any other consultation or occupation. see them here against us in war:— nl                domitosque hercule manu nl           telluris juvenes, unde periculum nl           fulgens contre mu it domus nl           saturai veteris. nl           ""the brawny sons of earth, subdu'd by hand nl           of hercules on the phlegran strand, nl           where the rude shock did such an uproar make, nl           as made old saturn's sparkling palace shake."" nl and here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a return for our having so often shared in theirs:— nl           neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti nl           fundamenta quatit, totamque  sedibus urbem nl           emit: hie juno scas svissima portas prima tenet. nl                ""amidst that smother neptune holds his place, nl           below the walls' foundation drives his mace, nl           and heaves the city from its solid base. nl           see where in arms the cruel juno stands, nl            full in the scan gate."" nl the caunians, jealous of the authority of their own proper gods, armed themselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords, by that means to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory. their powers are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that the phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: adeo minimis etiam rebus prava religio inserit deos? ""at such a rate does false religion create gods for the most contemptible uses."" this one makes grapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that over merchandise; for every sort of artisan a god; this has his province and reputation in the east; that his in the west:— nl                ""here lay her armour, here her chariot stood."" nl                o sancte apollo, qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines! nl                  ""o sacred phoebus, who with glorious ray, nl            from the earth's centre, dost thy light display."" nl           pallada cecropid, minola creta dianam, nl            vulcanum tellus hypsipylea colit, nl           junonem sparte, pelopeladesque mycen; nl           pinigerum fauni mnalis ora caput; nl           mars latio venerandus. nl                ""th' athenians pallas, cynthia crete adore, nl            vulcan is worshipped on the lemnian shore. nl            proud juno's altars are by spartans fed, nl           th' arcadians worship faunus, and 'tis said nl           to mars, by italy, is homage paid."" nl to our necessity; this cures horses, that men, nl           hic illius arma, hic currus fuit. nl this has only one town or family in his possession; that lives alone; that in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:— nl                junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo. nl                 ""and temples to the nephew joined are, nl           to those were reared to the great-grandfather."" nl in here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and thirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce one ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a door—that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold. four to a child—protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and sucking. some certain, some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are not yet entered paradise:— nl                quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore, nl           quas dedimus cert terras habitare sinanras: nl                ""whom, since we yet not worthy think of heaven, nl           we suffer to possess the earth we've given."" nl there are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. some of a mean betwixt the divine and human nature; mediators betwixt god and us, adorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite in titles and offices; some good; others ill; some old and decrepit, and some that are mortal. for chrysippus was of opinion that in the last conflagration of the world all the gods were to die but jupiter. man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt god and him; is he not his countryman? nl           jovis incunabula creten. nl           ""crete, the cradle of jupiter."" nl and this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject, scvola, a high priest, and varro, a great theologian in their times, make us: ""that it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true, and believe many things that are false."" quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur. ""seeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be made free, 'tis fit he should be deceived."" human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap miserable phton took for attempting to guide his father's horses with a mortal hand. the mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. if you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will she return, if not that it is iron, or, with anaxagoras, stone, or some other matter that she makes use of? if a man inquire of zeno what nature is? ""a fire,"" says he, ""an artisan, proper for generation, and regularly proceeding."" archimedes, master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty; ""the sun,"" says he, ""is a god of red-hot iron."" was not this a fine imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations? yet not so inevitable and useful but that socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold; and that polynus, who had been a great and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of epicurus. socrates in xenophon, concerning this affair, says of anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, ""that he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:"" when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse, that it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that we are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and plants. 'tis socrates's opinion, and mine too, that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all. plato having occasion, in his timous, to speak of the demons, ""this undertaking,"" says he, ""exceeds my ability."" we are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them; 'tis against all reason to refuse a man's faith to the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things. nl let us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things. is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain, another body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:— nl                 temo aureus, aurea summ nl             curvatura rot, radiorum argenteus ordo. nl                 ""gold was the axle, and the beam was gold; nl            the wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll'd."" nl you would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters, that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity, according to plato:— nl                mundus domus est maxima rerum, nl           quam quinque altiton fragmine zon nl           cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis nl           stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo there, lun nl           bigas acceptat. nl                ""the world's a mansion that doth all things hold, nl           which thundering zones, in number five, enfold, nl           through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs, nl           and that with sparkling constellations, shines, nl           in heaven's arch marks the diurnal course nl           for the sun's chariot and his fiery horse."" nl these are all dreams and fanatic follies. why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? good god, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science! i am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is, and i shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance. nl have i not read in plato this divine saying, that ""nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy!"" as if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures: latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit. ""all those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth."" and certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. plato is but a poet unripped. timon calls him, insultingly, ""a monstrous forger of miracles."" all superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say, legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice); she gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she herself informs us were invented; for these epicycles, eccentrics, and concentrics, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject; as also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really is, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest invention. plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts, says, ""i should know that what i have said is truth, had i the confirmation of an oracle; but this i will affirm, that what i have said is the most likely to be true of any thing i could say."" nl 'tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels; let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our contexture. nl there is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found out in this poor little human body. in earnest, they have good reason, upon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it. to assist the motions they see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in how many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it? in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to be perceived? and how many offices and vocations have they assigned him? they make it an imaginary public thing. 'tis a subject that they hold and handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place, displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and yet they possess it not they cannot, not in reality only, but even in dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches. and it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven, earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and despise them if they fail in it. nl i am very well pleased with the milesian girl, who observing the philosopher thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and to have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet. doubtless she advised him well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as democritus says, by the mouth of cicero,— nl              quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas. nl                   ""no man regards what is under his feet; nl              they are always prying towards heaven."" nl but our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the stars. as socrates says, in plato, ""that whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. for every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether beasts or men."" nl those people, who find sebond's arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the world, that know all,— nl                 qu mare compescant caus; quid temperet annum; nl            stell sponte su, jussve, vagentur et errent; nl           quid premat obscurum lun, quid profrt orbem; nl           quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors; nl                 ""what governs ocean's tides, nl           and through the various year the seasons guides; nl           whether the stars by their own proper force, nl            or foreign power, pursue their wand'ring course; nl           why shadows darken the pale queen of night; nl            whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;— nl           what nature's jarring sympathy can mean;"" nl have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being? we see very well that the finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another paleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon the brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members; at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies something lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet man knew: omnia incerta ratione, et in natur majestate abdita. ""all uncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,"" says pliny. and st augustin, modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus.... omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse homo est, ""the manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man."" and yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if it were religion and law. 'tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is admitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to be accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies. the reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root, where the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches; they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether galen has said any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. in truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and arts. the god of scholastic knowledge is aristotle; 'tis irreligion to question any of his decrees, as it was those of lucurgus at sparta; his doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as another. i do not know why i should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of plato, or the atoms of epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of leucippus and democritus, or the water of thales, or the infinity of nature of anaximander, or the air of diogenes, or the numbers and symmetry of pythagoras, or the infinity of parmenides, or the one of musus, or the water and fire of apollodorus, or the similar parts of anaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of empedocles, or the fire of heraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as i should the opinion of aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces—matter, form, and privation. and what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things? privation is a negative; of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are? and yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire. nl it is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please; for, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. by this way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture; for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our god; he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds, if he so please. in this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of pythagoras, ""that every expert person ought to be believed in his own art"" for current pay. the logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check. if you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this sentence in their mouths, ""that there is no disputing with persons who deny principles."" now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the end, is nothing but dream and vapour. to those that contend upon presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is. for every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make the difference. wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. the persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less philosophers, than the philodoxes of plato; we must inquire whether fire be hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge? nl and as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid to put ice into his bosom;—they are pitiful things, unworthy of the profession of philosophy. if they had let us alone in our natural being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they might then have reason to talk at that rate; but 'tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world; 'tis from them that we derive this fancy, ""that human reason is controller-general of all that is without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and understood."" this answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy the happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without aristotle's precepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. they need not tell us, ""it is true, for you see and feel it to be so;"" they must tell me whether i really feel what i think i do; and if i do feel it, they must then tell me why i feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, 'tis a test full of falsity, error, weakness, and defect. nl which way can we better prove it than by itself? if we are not to believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect of it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the almighty; there is her habitation and recess; 'tis thence that she imparts her rays, when god is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as balias issued from her father's head, to communicate herself to the world. nl now let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul, not of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which appertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:— nl                     ignoratur enim, qu sit natura animai; nl              nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur; nl              et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta; nl             an tenebras orci visat, vastasque lacunas, nl             an pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se. nl                 ""for none the nature of the soul doth know, nl             whether that it be born with us, or no; nl            or be infused into us at our birth, nl            and dies with us when we return to earth, nl            or then descends to the black shades below, nl            or into other animals does go."" nl crates and dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all, but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; plato, that it was a substance moving of itself; thales, a nature without repose; aedepiades, an exercising of the senses; hesiod and anaximander, a thing composed of earth and water; parmenides, of earth and fire; empedocles, of blood:— nl           sanguineam vomit ille animam; nl           ""he vomits up his bloody soul."" nl posidonius, cleanthes, and galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion— nl           igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo; nl            ""their vigour of fire and of heavenly race."" nl hippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; varro, that it was an air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart, and diffused throughout the whole body; zeno, the quintessence of the four elements; heraclides ponticus, that it was the light; zenocrates and the egyptians, a mobile number; the chaldeans, a virtue without any determinate form:— nl                habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse, nl           harmoniam grci quam dicunt. nl                ""a certain vital habit in man's frame, nl           which harmony the grecian sages name."" nl let us not forget aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect lactantius, seneca, and most of the dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand; after all this enumeration of opinions, harum sententiarum quo vera sit, deus aliquis viderit: ""of these opinions which is the true, let some god determine,"" says cicero. ""i know by myself,"" says st bernard, ""how incomprehensible god is, seeing i cannot comprehend the parts of my own being."" nl heraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound was the essence of it. nl neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it. hippocrates and hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain; democritus and aristotle throughout the whole body;— nl  nl                ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse nl            corporis, et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis; nl                 ""as when the body's health they do it call, nl           when of a sound man, that's no part at all."" nl epicurus in the stomach; nl                hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus; nl           hc loca circum ltiti mulcent. nl                ""for this the seat of horror is and fear, nl           and joys in turn do likewise triumph here."" nl the stoics, about and within the heart; erasistratus, adjoining the membrane of the epicranium; empedocles, in the blood; as also moses, which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts, because the soul is there seated; galen thought that every part of the body had its soul; strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; qu facie quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est: ""what figure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired into,"" says cicero. i very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should i alter eloquence itself? besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. but the reason why chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; ""it is,"" says he, ""because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies i, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach."" this place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. no human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. why do we fear to say? the stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. but the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change. nl the extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. the beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be ""a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of plato."" nl and what did the epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. and even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? ""if the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the iliad?""—""whatever is capable of reason,"" says zeno, ""is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason."" cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of zeno: ""the whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise."" there are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions. nl whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. i willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found. nl for my part, i am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. this same plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after socrates, ""that he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand."" by this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. they profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. they will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science. nl i advised a person in italy, who had a great mind to speak italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether latin, french, spanish, or gascon, and that, by adding the italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either tuscan, roman, venetian, piedmontese, or neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. i say the same of philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. ""nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers."" and i am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, i know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, ""see whence he took it!"" my manners are natural, i have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb i went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. i never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher. nl but to return to the soul. inasmuch as plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. and the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body nl                 medium non deserit unquam nl           coeli phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt. nl                 ""phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way; nl           yet all things doth illustrate with his ray."" nl as the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:— nl                ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus, nl            paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur. nl                ""the other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er nl           the body, does obey the reason's lore."" nl some have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:— nl                deum namque ire per omnes nl           terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum; nl           hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum, nl           quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas: nl           scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri nl           omnia; nec morti esse locum: nl                ""for god goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole nl           heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul; nl           each at its birth, from him all beings share, nl           both man and brute, the breath of vital air; nl           to him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain, nl           fly whence they sprung, and rest in god again, nl            spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay, nl            dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way."" nl others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers; nl                instillata patris virtus tibi; nl           fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis; nl                ""thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood: nl           for still the brave spring from the brave and good;"" nl and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:— nl                 denique cur acris violentia triste leonum nl           seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis nl           a patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitt artus? nl           si non certa suo quia semine seminioque nl           vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto. nl                ""for why should rage from the fierce lion's seed, nl           or from the subtle fox's craft, proceed; nl           or why the tim'rous and flying hart nl           his fear and trembling to his race impart; nl           but that a certain force of mind does grow, nl            and still increases as the bodies do?"" nl that thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children the faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the ill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had been some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory of their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:— nl                si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur, nl           cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus, nl           nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus? nl                ""for at our birth if it infused be, nl           why do we then retain no memory nl           of our foregoing life, and why no more nl           remember any thing we did before?"" nl for, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and purity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of the body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember, being got in the body, as plato said, ""that what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;"" a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. to say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:— nl                nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas, nl           omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum, nl           non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat. nl                ""for if the mind be changed to that degree nl           as of past things to lose all memory, nl           so great a change as that, i must confess, nl           appears to me than death but little less."" nl furthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account it had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. by this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of epicurus and democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:— nl                gigni pariter cum corpore, et una nl           crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem. nl                ""souls with the bodies to be born we may nl           discern, with them t' increase, with them decay."" nl they perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness; capable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and languor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the foot; nl                mentem sanari, corpus ut grum, nl             ceraimus, et flecti medicin posse videmus; nl                 ""sick minds, as well as bodies, we do see nl            by med'cine's virtue oft restored to be;"" nl dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some medicaments, and roused by others,— nl                corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est, nl            corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat; nl                ""there must be of necessity, we find, nl           a nature that's corporeal of the mind, nl           because we evidently see it smarts nl             and wounded is with shafts the body darts;"" nl they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability of reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents; the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge,— nl                vis.... animal conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum nl           disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno; nl                ""the power of the soul's disturbed; and when nl           that once is but sequestered from her, then nl            by the same poison 'tis dispersed abroad;"" nl and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:— nl               vis morbi distracta per artus nl           turbat agens animam, spumantes quore salso nl          ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und. nl               ""throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease nl          disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas, nl          the foaming waves to swell and boil we see, nl           stirred by the wind's impetuosity."" nl now, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in a philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled, overturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain. nl                 morbis in corporis avius errat nl           spe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur; nl           interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum nl          ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti: nl          ""for when the body's sick, and ill at ease, nl          the mind doth often share in the disease; nl           wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by nl          a heavy and a stupid lethargy, nl          is overcome and cast into a deep, nl          a most profound and everlasting sleep."" nl the philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more than another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: ""the soul is either mortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it will change for the better.""—they never touch the other branch, ""what if she change for the worse?"" and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments. but thereby they make themselves a good game. these are two omissions that i often meet with in their discourses. i return to the first. nl this soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and so firm. our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. as to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal, was unimaginable:— nl               quippe etenim mortale terao jungere, et una nl          consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse, nl          desipere est. quid enim diversius esse putandum est, nl          aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque, nl          quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni nl           junctum, in concilio, svas tolerare procellas? nl                ""the mortal and th' eternal, then, to blend, nl          and think they can pursue one common end, nl          is madness: for what things more diff'rent are. nl          distinct in nature, and disposed to jar? nl          how can it then be thought that these should bear, nl          when thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?"" nl moreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body:— nl          simul ovo fessa fatiscit: nl          ""fatigued together with the weight of years:"" nl which, according to zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it ""as a fainting and fall of the soul, as well as of the body:"" contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere: and, what they perceived in some, that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire:— nl               non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet gri, nl          in nullo caput interea sit forte dolore. nl               ""so, often of the gout a man complains, nl          whose head is, at the same time, free from pains."" nl the sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl's eyes are to the splendour of the sun, says aristotle. by what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? for the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by pherecydes nl syrius, in the time of king tullus (though some attribute it to thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and nl reservation. the most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the academy. no one doubts what aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: ""a thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers."" he conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself. nl two things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful nl repute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. he has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. the soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. but 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: ""they are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher,"" says one of the ancients. by which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. all things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that god wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of babel. whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. we corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. what course soever man takes of himself, god still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. ""i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."" the diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? this saint has very much obliged me: ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio ""the very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption."" to what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly! nl but to return to my subject. it was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to god only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. let us ingenuously confess that god alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. and whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. the more we give and confess to owe and render to god, we do it with the greater christianity. that which this stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from god? cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. utor hc public persuasione. ""when we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. i make use of this public persuasion."" now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. let us omit the stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. ""they give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,"") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. the most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: ""that souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;"" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that euphorbus, afterwards hermotimus, and, finally, from pyrrhus was passed into pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. and some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:— nl               o pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est nl          sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti nl           corpora? qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido? nl                 ""o, father, is it then to be conceiv'd nl          that any of these spirits, so sublime, nl          should hence to the celestial regions climb, nl           and thence return to earth to reassume nl           their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb? nl           for wretched life whence does such fondness come?"" nl origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate. the opinion that varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. observe her progress elsewhere: ""the soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with."" but i will not omit the objection the epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. for the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive. nl               denique comrabia ad veneris, partusque ferarum nl          esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur; nl          et spectare immortales mortalia membra nl          innumero numro, certareque prproperanter nl           inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter. nl               ""absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget, nl          or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait, nl          expect the falling body, fight and strive nl          which first shall enter in and make it live."" nl others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. some make it immortal, without nl sense or knowledge. there are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. ""we are told,"" says he, ""and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end."" but who desires to see him—him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, i refer him to his treatise of the moon, and of the demon of socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. see here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul. nl neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite socrates was, according to aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; epicurus, an extract from soul and body; aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? aristotle and democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, ""for what term women carry their fruit?"" and i, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. the world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree. nl here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part we have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. i think i have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. ""as if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own."" in earnest, protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. when thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible. nl you,* for whom i have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of persia, darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on, nl          * the author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing nl           margaret de valois. nl though he should run them both through at once. i have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. the portuguese, in the indian sea, took certain turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. we here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. remember the tuscan proverb:— nl           chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza. nl          ""who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool."" nl i advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; i am an enemy to all extravagant ways. you, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. but here is as much as you will stand in need of. nl epicurus said of the laws, ""that the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another."" and plato affirms, ""that without laws we should live like beasts."" our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. it is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. and yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. in earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. and therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. but if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company. nl the liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. but now that men go all one way, qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, ""who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,"" and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. in like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. we need to know no more but that mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of venus in the thumb, and that of mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. i leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies. nl theophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, i do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, i lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him, nl                ut hymettia sole nl          cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas nl           vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;

if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi: nl ""one thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same."" now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. if we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy, nl          mulciber in trojam, pro troj stabat apollo; nl          ""vulcan against, for troy apollo stood;"" nl when are we to expect that they will be agreed? we are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. if man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? it is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood. nl the academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. and to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. the pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? if our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect this appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. but why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? how should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot if our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: ""amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind."" that things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that i seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men. nl let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, i mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number. nl besides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. how variously do we judge of things?—how often do we alter our opinions? what i hold and believe to-day i hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; i could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than i do this; i am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which i have since judged to be false? a man must at least become wise at his own expense; if i have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can i now have more than at other times? is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all. nl     posterior.... res ilia reperta nl          perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne. nl          ""the last things we find out are always best, nl           and make us to disrelish all the rest."" nl whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it the things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if god for this end did not prepare it, if god did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. at least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived. nl now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. it is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? do you believe that catullus's verses, or those of sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? cleomenes, the son of anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; ""i believe it,"" said he; ""neither am i the same man now as when i am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before."" in our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, gaudeat de bon fortun ; ""let him rejoice in his good fortune;"" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. that venerable senate of the areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. the very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in cicero:— nl               tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse nl          jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras. nl               ""men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air, nl          dark or serene, as days are foul or fair."" nl 'tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,—the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that i believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order. nl as to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. i always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. how uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip. nl i, that watch myself as narrowly as i can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere, nl               quis sub arcto rex gelid metuatur or, nl          quid tyridatem terreat, unice securus, nl               ""i care not whom the northern clime reveres, nl          or what's the king that tyridates fears,"" nl dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness i find in myself my foot is so unstable and unsteady, i find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, i am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, i am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, i am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. the same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: i am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. i have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either i am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, i am as merry as a cricket. when i take a book in hand i have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, i may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. even in my own writings i do not always find the air of my first fancy; i know not what i would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because i have lost the first that was better. i do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams:— nl               velut minuta magno nl          deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento. nl              ""like a small bark that's tost upon the main. nl          when winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain."" nl very often, as i am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that i no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it i am, as it were, misled by the side to which i incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as i do. preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. you only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. nay, i do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. the shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. and whoever should maintain this, siding with the peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; semper ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; ""ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:"" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice. nl irregular desires moved themistocles, and demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. and this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of god, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! in short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. may not this be one of the reasons that moved the epicureans to discharge god from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. ""as it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it."" nl what varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! what assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? if our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it? nl is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? we better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. the two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep. nl this is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. i was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. but does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed? nl i, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. but the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. i have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for i am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that i do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; i perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as i was, wholly to seize and possess me. so that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; i evidently saw the advantages of the object i desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, i was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? pyrrho knows nothing about it. we are never without sickness. agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as i had advanced, so much i retired:— nl               qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus, nl          nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam nl          spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam; nl          nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens nl          saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit. nl               ""so swelling surges, with a thundering roar, nl          driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore, nl          bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land, nl          and far upon the beach heave up the sand; nl          then backward rapidly they take their way, nl          repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea."" nl now, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, i have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, i do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as i am not capable of choosing, i take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein god has placed me; i could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. thus have i, by the grace of god, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. the writings of the ancients, the best authors i mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that i am reading seems always to have the most force; and i find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. the facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. the heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till cleanthes the samian, or, according to theophrastus, nicetas of syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. and copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? and who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former. nl               sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum: nl          quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore; nl          porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit, nl          inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum nl          laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore. nl                ""thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time, nl           what now is valued passes soon its prime; nl          to which some other thing, despised before, nl           succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more; nl          and once received, too faint all praises seem, nl          so highly it is rais'd in men's esteem."" nl so that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. before the principles that aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. what patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? they are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. when any one presses me with a new argument, i ought to believe that what i cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. he that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. how long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'tis said that a new comer, called paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. i believe he will easily make this good, but i do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. we are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. a man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if i would give him the hearing. after i had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: ""what, then,"" said i, ""did those that sailed according to theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?"" ""that's fortune,"" answered he, ""but so it is that they were mistaken."" i replied that i had rather follow effects than reason. now these are things that often interfere with one another, and i have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as jacques pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. and the pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. the geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:— nl          nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur; nl          ""what's present pleases, and appears the best;"" nl but it remains to be seen whether, as ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? and whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine. nl plato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west the egyptian priests told herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; aristotle and cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling solomon and isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that god has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. in the most famous of the greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. and apuleius says of men: sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. ""that they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general."" alexander writ to his mother the narration of an egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. cicero and diodorus say that in their time the chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, aristotle, pliny, and others, that zoroaster flourished six thousand years before plato's time. plato says that they of the city of sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of athens was built a thousand years before the said city of sais; epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the west indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples. nl in earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, i have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. the human mind is a great worker of miracles! but this relation has, moreover, i know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of st andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. in one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one god, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words: nl ""from dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;"" as also the art of augury. the vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. it is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. and this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the mahometan and jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. but to proceed:— nl if nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? if we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: ""the climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,"" says vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the egyptian priests told solon: athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur attici; crassum thebis; itaque pingues thebani, et valentes: ""the air of athens is subtle and thin; whence also the athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong."" in such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why cyrus would not grant the persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. if we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so? nl methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:— nl               quid enim ratione timemus, nl           aut cupimus? quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te nl          conatus non poniteat, votique peracti? nl               ""for what, with reason, do we speak or shun, nl          what plan, how happily soe'r begun, nl          that, when achieved, we do not wish undone?"" nl and therefore it was that socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private and public prayer of the lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the supreme power:— nl               conjugium petimus, partumqu uxoris;

his prayer was heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers. nl               attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque, nl          effugere optt opes, et, qu modo voverat, odit. nl               ""astonished at the strangeness of the ill, nl          to be so rich, yet miserable still;

instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and lower. cleobis and bito, trophonius and agamedes, having requested, the first of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of their piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us. god might grant us riches, honours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us. if he sends us death, or an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, vvrga tua et baculus, tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. ""thy rod and thy staff have comforted me,"" he does it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it in good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand nl               si consilium vis: nl          permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid nl          conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris... nl          carior est illis homo quam sibi; nl               ""if thou'lt be rul'd, to th' gods thy fortunes trust, nl          their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just. nl          what best may profit or delight they know, nl          and real good, for fancied bliss, bestow; nl          with eyes of pity, they our frailties scan, nl          more dear to them, than to himself, is man;"" nl for to require of him honours and commands, is to require 'that he may throw you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of the like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit doubtful. nl there is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers, as about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the calculation of varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. qui autem de summo bono dissentit, de tot philosophies ratione disputt.

""that we follow the laws of our country;"" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; i cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. what kind of virtue is that which i see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? what sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them? nl but they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest now they are so unfortunate, (for what can i call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, i say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. but let them produce me one of this condition. proctagoras and aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; thrasymachus, in plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. there is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:— nl               gentes esse ferantur, nl          in quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti nl          jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore; nl               ""there are some nations in the world, 'tis said, nl          where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed; nl          and their affections thereby higher rise, nl          more firm and constant by these double ties;"" nl the murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other. nl it is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: ""therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art."" subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view. nl there is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. it is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms. nl lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods. nl dionysius, the tyrant, offered plato a robe of the persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; plato refused it, saying, ""that being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;"" but aristippus accepted it with this answer, ""that no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage."" his friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that dionysius had spit in his face, ""fishermen,"" said he, ""suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon."" diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, ""if thou couldst live on cabbage,"" said he, ""thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;"" to whom aristippus replied, ""and if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages."" thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:— nl               bellum, o terra hospita, portas: nl          bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur. nl          sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti nl          quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;

""why,"" replied he, ""hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?"" we have our ears bored; the greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. we retire in private to enjoy our wives; the indians do it in public. the scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere temples were a refuge:— nl                inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum nl          odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos nl          esse deos, quos ipse colit. nl               ""thus 'tis the popular fury that creates nl          that all their neighbours' gods each nation hates; nl          each thinks its own the genuine; in a word, nl          the only deities to be adored."" nl i have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt bartolus and aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties, writ in the margin of his book, ""a question for a friend;"" that is to say, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit 'twas only for want of wit that he did not write ""a question for a friend"" throughout. the advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. in so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause. nl as to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. arcesilaus said, ""that in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:"" et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. ""and obscene pleasures, if nature requires them,"" epicurus thinks, ""are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved."" these last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that dicarchus threw into the teeth of plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom. nl laws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable, nl that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. it is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. chrysippus said, ""that a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives."" nl that philosopher would hardly have advised clisthenes to have refused hippoclides the fair agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the peripatetics, of which he had been till then. that which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. the other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:— nl               mochus es aufidi, qui vir, nl          scvine, fuisti: nl          rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est. nl           cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor? nl          numquid securus non potes arrigere? nl this experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:— nl               nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet nl          uxorem gratis, cciliane, tuam, nl          dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens nl          turba fututorum est. ingeniosus homo es. nl a philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, ""i am planting man;"" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic. nl it is, i suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. but he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. to those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, ""because i am hungry in the open street."" the women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and hipparchia was not received into crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. these philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others. nl heraclitus and protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing. nl this opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! what heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. a person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science. nl by this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. there is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the sibyls, say what he will. there are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;—a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. this it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please. nl is it possible that homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. and what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. do but observe how plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. they draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. from the same foundation that heraclitus and this sentence of his had, ""that all things had in them those forms that we discern,"" democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,—""that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;"" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. the pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. the cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat protagoras believed that ""what seems true to every one, is true to every one."" the epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation. nl this discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and prof of our ignorance. whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:— nl                 via qua munita fidei nl           proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis; nl               ""it is the surest path that faith can find nl          by which to enter human heart and mind."" nl science begins by them, and is resolved into them. after all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. he that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. the senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:— nl                invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam nl           notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli.... nl            quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi debet? nl               ""of truth, whate'er discoveries are made, nl           are by the senses to us first conveyed; nl          nor will one sense be baffled; for on what nl          can we rely more safely than on that?"" nl let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. cicero says, that chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: ""o miserable! thy force has destroyed thee."" there can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty. nl the first consideration i have upon the subject of the senses is that i make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. i see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? for if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:— nl                  an poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures nl             tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris? nl           an confutabunt nares, oculive revincent? nl                 ""can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct? nl            or is that touch by tasting to be check'd? nl           or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes nl            confute in their peculiar faculties?"" nl they all make the extremest limits of our ability:— nl                seorsum cuique potestas divisa est, sua vis cuique est, nl               ""each has its power distinctly and alone, nl          and every sense's power is its own."" nl it is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. it is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all. nl i have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. they brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, ""good god,"" said he, ""what a fine child! how beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!"" he will say, like one of us, ""this room has a very fine prospect;—it is clear weather;—the sun shines bright."" and moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. one cries out to him, ""here's a hare!"" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, ""the hare is killed,"" he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. he will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide. nl who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? what do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? we seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. there is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. if we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. we have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence. nl the sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. from this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: ""that every subject has in itself all we there find. that it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;"" and that of the epicureans, ""that the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:—"" nl                 quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura, nl          quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur: nl               ""but be it what it will in our esteems, nl          it is no bigger than to us it seems:"" nl that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:— nl               nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum.... nl          proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli: nl               ""yet that the eye's deluded we deny; nl          charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:"" nl ""and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses."" timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. the most absurd of all absurdities, with the epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:— nl                   proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est nl             et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam, nl             cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint nl             visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem nl             beddere mendose causas utriusque figur, nl            quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam, nl             et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota nl             fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque: nl             non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa nl            concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis, nl             procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint nl            in genere hoc fugienda. nl                 ""that what we see exists i will maintain, nl           and if our feeble reason can't explain nl             why things seem square when they are very near, nl             and at a greater distance round appear; nl            'tis better yet, for him that's at a pause, nl           't' assign to either figure a false cause, nl           than shock his faith, and the foundations rend nl          on which our safety and our life depend: nl          for reason not alone, but life and all, nl          together will with sudden ruin fall; nl          unless we trust our senses, nor despise nl          to shun the various dangers that arise."" nl this so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him. he cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. in case what the epicureans say be true, viz: ""that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;"" and if that also be true which the stoics say, ""that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,"" we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all. nl as to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. in the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:— nl               exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes, nl          classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem nl          apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens nl          insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur... nl          et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur, nl          qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus.... nl          ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit nl          flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur nl          vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim. nl                ""and rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head, nl          though far disjoined, though royal navies spread, nl          their sails between; yet if from distance shown, nl          they seem an island all combin'd in one. nl          thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale, nl          seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail nl          that ride at anchor safe; and all admire, nl          as they row by, to see the rocks retire. nl          thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood, nl          and i look'd downward on the rolling flood; nl          though he stood still, i thought he did divide nl          the headlong streams, and strive against the tide, nl          and all things seem'd to move on every side."" nl take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. i set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—""that the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue."" there is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. for my part i do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of horace or catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and zeno had reason to say ""that the voice was the flower of beauty."" one would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. and therefore philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, ""i break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine."" to what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? and that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from spain, and this pearl-powder from the ocean sea. our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:— nl                auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur nl          crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni. nl          spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras: nl          decipit hac oculos gide dives amor. nl                ""by dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades nl           make up the pageant that your heart invades; nl           in all that glittering figure which you see, nl          the far least part of her own self is she; nl          in vain for her you love amidst such cost nl          you search, the mistress in such dress is lost."" nl what a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow, nl               cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse; nl          se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur; nl          dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet: nl               ""admireth all; for which to be admired; nl          and inconsiderately himself desir'd. nl          the praises which he gives his beauty claim'd, nl          who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:"" nl and pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman! nl               oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque, nl          et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;

he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. i have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though i am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, i was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though i stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless i would. where i also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: ""'to that one cannot look without dizziness;"" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. and therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, ""for it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear."" physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. i have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. of what use was that piping prompter of gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? in earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind. nl the same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. what we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:— nl                et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere thebas. nl               ""thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns."" nl the object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is; nl               multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus nl          esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere; nl               ""hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress nl          seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;"" nl and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts? nl                in rebus quoque apertis noscere possis, nl          si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni nl          tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot: nl                ""nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind nl          take heed, unless she sets herself to find, nl          the thing no more is seen, no more belov'd, nl          than if the most obscure and most remov'd:"" nl it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. and so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood. nl they who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. when we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and cimmerian darkness. we wake sleeping, and sleep waking. i do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, i never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep? nl if the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. but betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:— nl               tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est, nl           ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum. nl          spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv, nl          disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa: nl                ""and in those things the difference is so great nl          that what's one's poison is another's meat; nl          for serpents often have been seen, 'tis said, nl          when touch'd with human spittle, to go mad, nl          and bite themselves to death:"" nl what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? by which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for? nl pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them. which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? one quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? to them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:— nl               lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur arquati. nl                ""besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view nl          looks pale as well as those, and yellow too."" nl they who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody. what do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. when we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. if we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:— nl                bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis... nl          et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina. nl               ""one lamp seems double, and the men appear nl          each on two bodies double heads to bear."" nl if our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. we see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:— nl               et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela, nl          et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris, nl          per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent; nl          namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem nl          scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque nl          inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore: nl               ""thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red, nl          o'er all the spacious theatre are spread, nl          which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear, nl          and the loose curtains wanton in the air; nl          whole streams of colours from the summit flow, nl          the rays divide them in their passage through, nl          and stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:"" nl 'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes. nl we should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. a child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. the senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. we receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come so a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. what! do our senses themselves hinder one another? a picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? there are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. they who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,—whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? as we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:— nl                 ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes, nl         disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se; nl                 ""as meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose nl         their former state, and different things compose;"" nl the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, i would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? and upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? he whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:— nl                  denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima, nl          normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit, nl          et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum; nl         omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est, nl         prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta; nl         jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque nl         prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis; nl         sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est, nl         falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est. nl                 ""but lastly, as in building, if the line nl         be not exact and straight, the rule decline, nl         or level false, how vain is the design! nl         uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall nl         must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall, nl         because the rules were false that fashion'd all; nl         thus reason's rules are false if all commence nl         and rise from failing and from erring sense."" nl as to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? as we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. we must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was. nl to judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. and to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? as they who never knew socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation. nl we have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. so, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that homer had made the ocean and thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:— nl              mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas, nl         ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet; nl         nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant, nl         omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit. nl             ""for time the nature of the world translates, nl         and from preceding gives all things new states; nl         nought like itself remains, but all do range, nl         and nature forces every thing to change."" nl ""and yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. and that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? how comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? how comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? for it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. but what is it then that truly is? that which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. for time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. and as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. the same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. so that it were sinful to say of god, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that god alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end."" to this so religious conclusion of a pagan i shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: ""what a vile and abject thing,"" says he, ""is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!"" 'tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. he shall be exalted, if god will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. it belongs to our christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis."
3,Ted Fresco,Sunny Day,"                                                            i nl     it was by accident that babbitt had his opportunity to address the s. a. r. e. b. nl     the s. a. r. e. b., as its members called it, with the universal passion for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the state association of real estate boards; the organization of brokers and operators. it was to hold its annual convention at monarch, zenith's chief rival among the cities of the state. babbitt was an official delegate; another was cecil rountree, whom babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building, and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest dances on royal ridge. rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee. nl     babbitt had growled to him, ""makes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' a good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em."" nl     ""right you are! i say: why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at the s. a. r. e. b.?"" suggested rountree. nl     ""well, if it would help you in making up the program—tell you: the way i look at it is this: first place, we ought to insist that folks call us 'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' sounds more like a reg'lar profession. second place—what is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade, business, or occupation? what is it? why, it's the public service and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all that, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never considers the-public service and trained skill and so on. now as a professional—"" nl     ""rather! that's perfectly bully! perfectly corking! now you write it in a paper,"" said rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away. nl     ii nl     however accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and correspondence, babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read. nl     he laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife's collapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. the household had been bullied into silence; verona and ted requested to disappear, and tinka threatened with ""if i hear one sound out of you—if you holler for a glass of water one single solitary time—you better not, that's all!"" mrs. babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown and gazing with respect while babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table. nl     when he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she marveled, ""i don't see how you can just sit down and make up things right out of your own head!"" nl     ""oh, it's the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in modern business life."" nl     he had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth: nl     {illustration omitted: consists of several doodles and ""(1) a profession (2) not just a trade crossed out (3) skill & vision (3) shd be called ""realtor"" & not just real est man""} nl     the other six pages were rather like the first. nl     for a week he went about looking important. every morning, as he dressed, he thought aloud: ""jever stop to consider, myra, that before a town can have buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some realtor has got to sell 'em the land? all civilization starts with him. jever realize that?"" at the athletic club he led unwilling men aside to inquire, ""say, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all through?"" he asked howard littlefield for a ""set of statistics about real-estate sales; something good and impressive,"" and littlefield provided something exceedingly good and impressive. nl     but it was to t. cholmondeley frink that babbitt most often turned. he caught frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while frink looked hunted and evasive, ""say, chum—you're a shark on this writing stuff—how would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript—manuscript now where the deuce is that?—oh, yes, here. would you say 'we ought not also to alone think?' or 'we ought also not to think alone?' or—"" nl     one evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, babbitt forgot about style, order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off what he really thought about the real-estate business and about himself, and he found the paper written. when he read it to his wife she yearned, ""why, dear, it's splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and interesting, and such splendid ideas! why, it's just—it's just splendid!"" nl     next day he cornered chum frink and crowed, ""well, old son, i finished it last evening! just lammed it out! i used to think you writing-guys must have a hard job making up pieces, but lord, it's a cinch. pretty soft for you fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! some day when i get ready to retire, guess i'll take to writing and show you boys how to do it. i always used to think i could write better stuff, and more punch and originality, than all this stuff you see printed, and now i'm doggone sure of it!"" nl     he had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title, had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to old ira runyon, the managing editor of the advocate-times, who said yes, indeed yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would read it all through—as soon as he could find time. nl     mrs. babbitt could not go to monarch. she had a women's-club meeting. babbitt said that he was very sorry. nl     iii nl     besides the five official delegates to the convention—babbitt, rountree, w. a. rogers, alvin thayer, and elbert wing—there were fifty unofficial delegates, most of them with their wives. nl     they met at the union station for the midnight train to monarch. all of them, save cecil rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore badges, displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered ""we zoom for zenith."" the official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta ribbons. martin lumsen's little boy willy carried a tasseled banner inscribed ""zenith the zip city—zeal, zest and zowie—1,000,000 in 1935."" as the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family automobile driven by the oldest son or by cousin fred, they formed impromptu processions through the station waiting-room. nl     it was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and frescoes depicting the exploration of the chaloosa river valley by pere emile fauthoux in 1740. the benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany; the news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. down the echoing spaces of the hall the delegates paraded after willy lumsen's banner, the men waving their cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks and strings of beads, all singing to the tune of auld lang syne the official city song, written by chum frink: nl         good old zenith, nl         our kin and kith, nl         wherever we may be, nl         hats in the ring, nl         we blithely sing nl         of thy prosperity. nl     warren whitby, the broker, who had a gift of verse for banquets and birthdays, had added to frink's city song a special verse for the realtors' convention: nl         oh, here we come, nl         the fellows from nl         zenith, the zip citee. nl         we wish to state nl         in real estate nl         there's none so live as we. nl     babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. he leaped on a bench, shouting to the crowd: nl     ""what's the matter with zenith?"" nl     ""she's all right!"" nl     ""what's best ole town in the u. s. a.?"" nl     ""zeeeeeen-ith!"" nl     the patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious wonder—italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes, roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new but which were faded now and wrinkled. nl     babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified. with wing and rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the waiting pullmans. motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity. arc-lights glared and stammered overhead. the glossy yellow sleeping-cars shone impressively. babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he thrust out his abdomen and rumbled, ""we got to see to it that the convention lets the legislature understand just where they get off in this matter of taxing realty transfers."" wing uttered approving grunts and babbitt swelled—gloated. nl     the blind of a pullman compartment was raised, and babbitt looked into an unfamiliar world. the occupant of the compartment was lucile mckelvey, the pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. possibly, babbitt thrilled, she was going to europe! on the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed foreign. while he stared, she picked up the book, then glanced out of the window as though she was bored. she must have looked straight at him, and he had met her, but she gave no sign. she languidly pulled down the blind, and he stood still, a cold feeling of insignificance in his heart. nl     but on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from sparta, pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened respectfully when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of zenith, he explained politics and the value of a good sound business administration. they fell joyfully into shop-talk, the purest and most rapturous form of conversation: nl     ""how'd this fellow rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he was going to put up? whadde do? get out bonds to finance it?"" asked a sparta broker. nl     ""well, i'll tell you,"" said babbitt. ""now if i'd been handling it—"" nl     ""so,"" elbert wing was droning, ""i hired this shop-window for a week, and put up a big sign, 'toy town for tiny tots,' and stuck in a lot of doll houses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, 'baby likes this dollydale, but papa and mama will prefer our beautiful bungalows,' and you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first week we sold—"" nl     the trucks sang ""lickety-lick, lickety-lick"" as the train ran through the factory district. furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were clanging. red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past, and babbitt was important again, and eager. nl     iv nl     he did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the train. in the morning, half an hour before they reached monarch, the porter came to his berth and whispered, ""there's a drawing-room vacant, sir. i put your suit in there."" in tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, babbitt slipped down the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first private compartment. the porter indicated that he knew babbitt was used to a man-servant; he held the ends of babbitt's trousers, that the beautifully sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the private washroom, and waited with a towel. nl     to have a private washroom was luxurious. however enlivening a pullman smoking-compartment was by night, even to babbitt it was depressing in the morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts, every hook filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled with dingy toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste. babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but now he reveled in it, reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a tip of a dollar and a half. nl     he rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed clothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked at monarch. nl     he was to share a room at the hotel sedgwick with w. a. rogers, that shrewd, rustic-looking zenith dealer in farm-lands. together they had a noble breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in large pots. babbitt grew expansive, and told rogers about the art of writing; he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the lobby, and sent to tinka a post-card: ""papa wishes you were here to bat round with him."" nl     v nl     the meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of the allen house. in an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the executive committee. he was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that he got nothing done whatever. he sat at a marquetry table, in a room littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, ""yes, yes, that's a fine idea; we'll do that,"" and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching, ""say, mr. chairman—say, mr. chairman!"" without penetrating his exhausted hearing. nl     in the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of sparta, pictures of the new state capitol, at galop de vache, and large ears of corn with the label, ""nature's gold, from shelby county, the garden spot of god's own country."" nl the real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in groups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a show of public meetings. nl     the first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of monarch. the pastor of the first christian church of monarch, a large man with a long damp frontal lock, informed god that the real-estate men were here now. nl     the venerable minnemagantic realtor, major carlton tuke, read a paper in which he denounced cooperative stores. william a. larkin of eureka gave a comforting prognosis of ""the prospects for increased construction,"" and reminded them that plate-glass prices were two points lower. nl     the convention was on. nl     the delegates were entertained, incessantly and firmly. the monarch chamber of commerce gave them a banquet, and the manufacturers' association an afternoon reception, at which a chrysanthemum was presented to each of the ladies, and to each of the men a leather bill-fold inscribed ""from monarch the mighty motor mart."" nl     mrs. crosby knowlton, wife of the manufacturer of fleetwing automobiles, opened her celebrated italian garden and served tea. six hundred real-estate men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths. perhaps three hundred of them were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred vigorously exclaimed, ""this is pretty slick, eh?"" surreptitiously picked the late asters and concealed them in their pockets, and tried to get near enough to mrs. knowlton to shake her lovely hand. without request, the zenith delegates (except rountree) gathered round a marble dancing nymph and sang ""here we come, the fellows from zenith, the zip citee."" nl     it chanced that all the delegates from pioneer belonged to the brotherly and protective order of elks, and they produced an enormous banner lettered: ""b. p. o. e.—best people on earth—boost pioneer, oh eddie."" nor was galop de vache, the state capital, to be slighted. the leader of the galop de vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish man, but active. he took off his coat, hurled his broad black felt hat on the ground, rolled up his sleeves, climbed upon the sundial, spat, and bellowed: nl     ""we'll tell the world, and the good lady who's giving the show this afternoon, that the bonniest burg in this man's state is galop de vache. you boys can talk about your zip, but jus' lemme murmur that old galop has the largest proportion of home-owning citizens in the state; and when folks own their homes, they ain't starting labor-troubles, and they're raising kids instead of raising hell! galop de vache! the town for homey folks! the town that eats 'em alive oh, bosco! we'll—tell—the—world!"" nl     the guests drove off; the garden shivered into quiet. but mrs. crosby knowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred summers of amalfi. on the face of a winged sphinx which supported it some one had drawn a mustache in lead-pencil. crumpled paper napkins were dumped among the michaelmas daisies. on the walk, like shredded lovely flesh, were the petals of the last gallant rose. cigarette stubs floated in the goldfish pool, trailing an evil stain as they swelled and disintegrated, and beneath the marble seat, the fragments carefully put together, was a smashed teacup. nl     vi nl     as he rode back to the hotel babbitt reflected, ""myra would have enjoyed all this social agony."" for himself he cared less for the garden party than for the motor tours which the monarch chamber of commerce had arranged. indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban trolley-stations, and tanneries. he devoured the statistics which were given to him, and marveled to his roommate, w. a. rogers, ""of course this town isn't a patch on zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural resources; but did you know—i nev' did till to-day—that they manufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last year? what d' you think of that!"" nl     he was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. when he stood on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw only a purple haze. but he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. they shouted ""that's the stuff!"" and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to ""our friend and brother, mr. george f. babbitt."" he had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, cecil rountree. after the meeting, delegates from all over the state said, ""hower you, brother babbitt?"" sixteen complete strangers called him ""george,"" and three men took him into corners to confide, ""mighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the profession a real boost. now i've always maintained—"" nl     next morning, with tremendous casualness, babbitt asked the girl at the hotel news-stand for the newspapers from zenith. there was nothing in the press, but in the advocate-times, on the third page—he gasped. they had printed his picture and a half-column account. the heading was ""sensation at annual land-men's convention. g. f. babbitt, prominent ziptown realtor, keynoter in fine address."" nl     he murmured reverently, ""i guess some of the folks on floral heights will sit up and take notice now, and pay a little attention to old georgie!"" nl     vii nl     it was the last meeting. the delegations were presenting the claims of their several cities to the next year's convention. orators were announcing that ""galop de vache, the capital city, the site of kremer college and of the upholtz knitting works, is the recognized center of culture and high-class enterprise;"" and that ""hamburg, the big little city with the logical location, where every man is open-handed and every woman a heaven-born hostess, throws wide to you her hospitable gates."" nl     in the midst of these more diffident invitations, the golden doors of the ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets, and a circus parade rolled in. it was composed of the zenith brokers, dressed as cowpunchers, bareback riders, japanese jugglers. at the head was big warren whitby, in the bearskin and gold-and-crimson coat of a drum-major. behind him, as a clown, beating a bass drum, extraordinarily happy and noisy, was babbitt. nl     warren whitby leaped on the platform, made merry play with his baton, and observed, ""boyses and girlses, the time has came to get down to cases. a dyed-in-the-wool zenithite sure loves his neighbors, but we've made up our minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like we've grabbed the condensed-milk business and the paper-box business and—"" nl     j. harry barmhill, the convention chairman, hinted, ""we're grateful to you, mr. uh, but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their bids now."" nl     a fog-horn voice blared, ""in eureka we'll promise free motor rides through the prettiest country—"" nl     running down the aisle, clapping his hands, a lean bald young man cried, ""i'm from sparta! our chamber of commerce has wired me they've set aside eight thousand dollars, in real money, for the entertainment of the convention!"" nl     a clerical-looking man rose to clamor, ""money talks! move we accept the bid from sparta!"" nl     it was accepted. nl     viii nl     the committee on resolutions was reporting. they said that whereas almighty god in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a sphere of higher usefulness some thirty-six realtors of the state the past year, therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that they were sorry god had done it, and the secretary should be, and hereby was, instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes, and to console the bereaved families by sending them each a copy. nl     a second resolution authorized the president of the s.a.r.e.b. to spend fifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the state legislature. this resolution had a good deal to say about menaces to sound business and clearing the wheels of progress from ill-advised and shortsighted obstacles. nl     the committee on committees reported, and with startled awe babbitt learned that he had been appointed a member of the committee on torrens titles. nl     he rejoiced, ""i said it was going to be a great year! georgie, old son, you got big things ahead of you! you're a natural-born orator and a good mixer and—zowie!"" nl     ix nl     there was no formal entertainment provided for the last evening. babbitt had planned to go home, but that afternoon the jered sassburgers of pioneer suggested that babbitt and w. a. rogers have tea with them at the catalpa inn. nl     teas were not unknown to babbitt—his wife and he earnestly attended them at least twice a year—but they were sufficiently exotic to make him feel important. he sat at a glass-covered table in the art room of the inn, with its painted rabbits, mottoes lettered on birch bark, and waitresses being artistic in dutch caps; he ate insufficient lettuce sandwiches, and was lively and naughty with mrs. sassburger, who was as smooth and large-eyed as a cloak-model. sassburger and he had met two days before, so they were calling each other ""georgie"" and ""sassy."" nl     sassburger said prayerfully, ""say, boys, before you go, seeing this is the last chance, i've got it, up in my room, and miriam here is the best little mixelogist in the stati unidos like us italians say."" nl     with wide flowing gestures, babbitt and rogers followed the sassburgers to their room. mrs. sassburger shrieked, ""oh, how terrible!"" when she saw that she had left a chemise of sheer lavender crepe on the bed. she tucked it into a bag, while babbitt giggled, ""don't mind us; we're a couple o' little divvils!"" nl     sassburger telephoned for ice, and the bell-boy who brought it said, prosaically and unprompted, ""highball glasses or cocktail?"" miriam sassburger mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal, nakedly white water-pitchers which exist only in hotels. when they had finished the first round she proved by intoning ""think you boys could stand another—you got a dividend coming"" that, though she was but a woman, she knew the complete and perfect rite of cocktail-drinking. nl     outside, babbitt hinted to rogers, ""say, w. a., old rooster, it comes over me that i could stand it if we didn't go back to the lovin' wives, this handsome abend, but just kind of stayed in monarch and threw a party, heh?"" nl     ""george, you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness. el wing's wife has gone on to pittsburg. let's see if we can't gather him in."" nl     at half-past seven they sat in their room, with elbert wing and two up-state delegates. their coats were off, their vests open, their faces red, their voices emphatic. they were finishing a bottle of corrosive bootlegged whisky and imploring the bell-boy, ""say, son, can you get us some more of this embalming fluid?"" they were smoking large cigars and dropping ashes and stubs on the carpet. with windy guffaws they were telling stories. they were, in fact, males in a happy state of nature. nl     babbitt sighed, ""i don't know how it strikes you hellions, but personally i like this busting loose for a change, and kicking over a couple of mountains and climbing up on the north pole and waving the aurora borealis around."" nl     the man from sparta, a grave, intense youngster, babbled, ""say! i guess i'm as good a husband as the run of the mill, but god, i do get so tired of going home every evening, and nothing to see but the movies. that's why i go out and drill with the national guard. i guess i got the nicest little wife in my burg, but—say! know what i wanted to do as a kid? know what i wanted to do? nl     wanted to be a big chemist. tha's what i wanted to do. but dad chased me out on the road selling kitchenware, and here i'm settled down—settled for life—not a chance! oh, who the devil started this funeral talk? how 'bout 'nother lil drink? 'and a-noth-er drink wouldn' do 's 'ny harmmmmmmm.'"" nl     ""yea. cut the sob-stuff,"" said w. a. rogers genially. ""you boys know i'm the village songster? come on nowsing up: nl         said the old obadiah to the young obadiah, nl         'i am dry, obadiah, i am dry.' nl         said the young obadiah to the old obadiah, nl         'so am i, obadiah, so am i.'"" nl     x nl     they had dinner in the moorish grillroom of the hotel sedgwick. somewhere, somehow, they seemed to have gathered in two other comrades: a manufacturer of fly-paper and a dentist. they all drank whisky from tea-cups, and they were humorous, and never listened to one another, except when w. a. rogers ""kidded"" the italian waiter. nl     ""say, gooseppy,"" he said innocently, ""i want a couple o' fried elephants' ears."" nl     ""sorry, sir, we haven't any."" nl     ""huh? no elephants' ears? what do you know about that!"" rogers turned to babbitt. ""pedro says the elephants' ears are all out!"" nl     ""well, i'll be switched!"" said the man from sparta, with difficulty hiding his laughter. nl     ""well, in that case, carlo, just bring me a hunk o' steak and a couple o' bushels o' french fried potatoes and some peas,"" rogers went on. ""i suppose back in dear old sunny it' the eyetalians get their fresh garden peas out of the can."" nl     ""no, sir, we have very nice peas in italy."" nl     ""is that a fact! georgie, do you hear that? they get their fresh garden peas out of the garden, in italy! by golly, you live and learn, don't you, antonio, you certainly do live and learn, if you live long enough and keep your strength. all right, garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with about two printers'-reams of french fried spuds on the promenade deck, comprehenez-vous, michelovitch angeloni?"" nl     afterward elbert wing admired, ""gee, you certainly did have that poor dago going, w. a. he couldn't make you out at all!"" nl     in the monarch herald, babbitt found an advertisement which he read aloud, to applause and laughter: nl old colony theatre nl     shake the old dogs to the wrollicking wrens the bonniest bevy of beauteous bathing babes in burlesque. pete menutti and his oh, gee, kids. nl     this is the straight steer, benny, the painless chicklets of the wrollicking wrens are the cuddlingest bunch that ever hit town. steer the feet, get the card board, and twist the pupils to the pdqest show ever. you will get 111% on your kale in this fun-fest. the calroza sisters are sure some lookers and will give you a run for your gelt. jock silbersteen is one of the pepper lads and slips you a dose of real laughter. shoot the up and down to jackson and west for graceful tappers. they run 1-2 under the wire. provin and adams will blow the blues in their laugh skit ""hootch mon!"" something doing, boys. listen to what the hep bird twitters. nl     ""sounds like a juicy show to me. let's all take it in,"" said babbitt. nl     but they put off departure as long as they could. they were safe while they sat here, legs firmly crossed under the table, but they felt unsteady; they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of the grillroom under the eyes of the other guests and the too-attentive waiters. nl     when they did venture, tables got in their way, and they sought to cover embarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom. as the girl handed out their hats, they smiled at her, and hoped that she, a cool and expert judge, would feel that they were gentlemen. they croaked at one another, ""who owns the bum lid?"" and ""you take a good one, george; i'll take what's left,"" and to the check-girl they stammered, ""better come along, sister! high, wide, and fancy evening ahead!"" all of them tried to tip her, urging one another, ""no! wait! here! i got it right here!"" among them, they gave her three dollars. nl     xi nl     flamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the burlesque show, their feet up on the rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more elementary chorus-evolutions, and a jewish comedian made vicious fun of jews. in the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. a dozen of them went in taxicabs out to bright blossom inn, where the blossoms were made of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable no longer wisely used. nl     here, whisky was served openly, in glasses. two or three clerks, who on pay-day longed to be taken for millionaires, sheepishly danced with telephone-girls and manicure-girls in the narrow space between the tables. fantastically whirled the professionals, a young man in sleek evening-clothes and a slim mad girl in emerald silk, with amber hair flung up as jaggedly as flames. babbitt tried to dance with her. he shuffled along the floor, too bulky to be guided, his steps unrelated to the rhythm of the jungle music, and in his staggering he would have fallen, had she not held him with supple kindly strength. he was blind and deaf from prohibition-era alcohol; he could not see the tables, the faces. but he was overwhelmed by the girl and her young pliant warmth. nl     when she had firmly returned him to his group, he remembered, by a connection quite untraceable, that his mother's mother had been scotch, and with head thrown back, eyes closed, wide mouth indicating ecstasy, he sang, very slowly and richly, ""loch lomond."" nl     but that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship. the man from sparta said he was a ""bum singer,"" and for ten minutes babbitt quarreled with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. they called for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. all the while babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. when w. a. rogers drawled, ""what say we go down the line and look over the girls?"" he agreed savagely. before they went, three of them secretly made appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed ""yes, yes, sure, darling"" to everything they said, and amiably forgot them. nl     as they drove back through the outskirts of monarch, down streets of small brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they rattled across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast and perilous, as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic pianos and the stocky women who simpered, babbitt was frightened. he wanted to leap from the taxicab, but all his body was a murky fire, and he groaned, ""too late to quit now,"" and knew that he did not want to quit. nl     there was, they felt, one very humorous incident on the way. a broker from minnemagantic said, ""monarch is a lot sportier than zenith. you zenith tightwads haven't got any joints like these here."" babbitt raged, ""that's a dirty lie! snothin' you can't find in zenith. believe me, we got more houses and hootch-parlors an' all kinds o' dives than any burg in the state."" nl     he realized they were laughing at him; he desired to fight; and forgot it in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since college. nl     in the morning, when he returned to zenith, his desire for rebellion was partly satisfied. he had retrograded to a shamefaced contentment. he was irritable. he did not smile when w. a. rogers complained, ""ow, what a head! i certainly do feel like the wrath of god this morning. say! i know what was the trouble! somebody went and put alcohol in my booze last night."" nl     babbitt's excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in zenith save rogers and wing. it was not officially recognized even by himself. if it had any consequences, they have not been discovered."

6,Sencha,Power,"introductory note nl the vast and interesting epic literature of ireland has remained, for the most part, inaccessible to english readers until these last sixty years. in 1853, nicholas o'kearney published the irish text and an english translation of ""the battle of gabra,"" and since that date the volume of printed texts and english versions has steadily increased. now there lies open to the ordinary reader a considerable mass of material illustrating the imaginative life of medieval ireland. nl of these irish epic tales, ""the destruction of dá derga's hostel"" is a specimen of remarkable beauty and power. the primitive aspects of the story are made evident in the way that the plot turns upon the disasters that follow on the violation of taboos, by the monstrous nature of many of the warriors, and by the absence of any attempt to explain the beliefs implied or the marvels related in it. the powers and achievements of the heroes are fantastic and extraordinary beyond description. the natural and extra-natural constantly mingle, yet nowhere does the narrator express surprise. the technical method of the tale, too, is curiously and almost mechanically symmetrical, after the manner of savage art. both description and narration are marked by a high degree of freshness and vividness. nl the following translation is, with slight modification, that of dr. whitley stokes, from a text constructed by him on the basis of eight manuscripts, the oldest going back to about 1100 a.d. the story itself is, without doubt, from several centuries earlier and belongs to the oldest group of extant irish sagas. nl the destruction nl of dá derga's hostel nl there was a famous and noble king over erin, named eochaid feidlech. once upon a time he came over the fairgreen of bri leith, and he saw at the edge of a well a woman with a bright comb of silver adorned with gold, washing in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds and little, bright gems of purple carbuncle in the rims of the basin. a mantle she had, curly and purple, a beautiful cloak, and in the mantle silvery fringes arranged, and a brooch of fairest gold. a kirtle she wore, long, hooded, hard-smooth, of green silk, with red embroidery of gold. marvellous clasps of gold and silver in the kirtle on her breasts and her shoulders and spaulds on every side. the sun kept shining upon her, so that the glistening of the gold against the sun from the green silk was manifest to men. on her head were two golden-yellow tresses, in each of which was a plait of four locks, with a bead at the point of each lock. the hue of that hair seemed to them like the flower of the iris in summer, or like red gold after the burnishing thereof. nl there she was, undoing her hair to wash it, with her arms out through the sleeve-holes of her smock. white as the snow of one night were the two hands, soft and even, and red as foxglove were the two clear-beautiful cheeks. dark as the back of a stag-beetle the two eyebrows. like a shower of pearls were the teeth in her head. blue as a hyacinth were the eyes. red as rowan-berries the lips. very high, smooth and soft-white the shoulders. clear-white and lengthy the fingers. long were the hands. white as the foam of a wave was the flank, slender, long, tender, smooth, soft as wool. polished and warm, sleek and white were the two thighs. round and small, hard and white the two knees. short and white and rulestraight the two shins. justly straight and beautiful the two heels. if a measure were put on the feet it would hardly have found them unequal, unless the flesh of the coverings should grow upon them. the bright radiance of the moon was in her noble face: the loftiness of pride in her smooth eyebrows: the light of wooing in each of her regal eyes. a dimple of delight in each of her cheeks, with a dappling (?) in them, at one time, of purple spots with redness of a calf's blood, and at another with the bright lustre of snow. soft womanly dignity in her voice; a step steady and slow she had: a queenly gait was hers. verily, of the world's women 'twas she was the dearest and loveliest and justest that the eyes of men had ever beheld. it seemed to king eochaid and his followers that she was from the elfmounds. of her was said: ""shapely are all till compared with etáin,"" ""dear are all till compared with etáin."" nl a longing for her straightway seized the king; so he sent forward a man of his people to detain her. the king asked tidings of her and said, while announcing himself: ""shall i have an hour of dalliance with thee?"" nl ""'tis for that we have come hither under thy safeguard,"" quoth she. nl ""query, whence art thou and whence hast thou come?"" says eochaid. nl ""easy to say,"" quoth she. ""etáin am i, daughter of etar, king of the cavalcade from the elfmounds. i have been here for twenty years since i was born in an elfmound. the men of the elfmound, both kings and nobles, have been wooing me: but nought was gotten from me, because ever since i was able to speak, i have loved thee and given thee a child's love for the high tales about thee and thy splendour. and though i had never seen thee, i knew thee at once from thy description: it is thou, then, i have reached."" nl ""no 'seeking of an ill friend afar' shall be thine,"" says eochaid. ""thou shalt have welcome, and for thee every other woman shall be left by me, and with thee alone will i live so long as thou hast honour."" nl ""my proper bride-price to me!"" she says, ""and afterwards my desire."" nl ""thou shalt have both,"" says eochaid. nl seven cumals are given to her. nl  nl then the king, even eochaid feidlech, dies, leaving one daughter named, like her mother, etáin, and wedded to cormac, king of ulaid. nl after the end of a time cormac, king of ulaid, ""the man of the three gifts,"" forsakes eochaid's daughter, because she was barren save for one daughter that she had borne to cormac after the making of the pottage which her mother--the woman from the elfmounds--gave her. then she said to her mother: ""bad is what thou hast given me: it will be a daughter that i shall bear."" nl ""that will not be good,"" says her mother; ""a king's pursuit will be on her."" nl then cormac weds again his wife, even etáin, and this was his desire, that the daughter of the woman who had before been abandoned  should be killed. so cormac would not leave the girl to her mother to be nursed. then his two thralls take her to a pit, and she smiles a laughing smile at them as they were putting her into it. then their kindly nature came to them. they carry her into the calfshed of the cowherds of etirscél, great-grandson of iar, king of tara, and they fostered her till she became a good embroideress; and there was not in ireland a king's daughter dearer than she. nl a fenced house of wickerwork was made by the thralls for her, without any door, but only a window and a skylight. king etercél's folk espy that house and suppose that it was food the cowherds kept there. but one of them went and looked through the skylight, and he saw in the house the dearest, beautifullest maiden! this is told to the king, and straightway he sends his people to break the house and carry her off without asking the cowherds. for the king was childless, and it had been prophesied to him by his wizards that a woman of unknown race would bear him a son. nl then said the king: ""this is the woman that has been prophesied to me!"" nl now while she was there next morning she saw a bird on the skylight coming to her, and he leaves his birdskin on the floor of the house, and went to her, and possessed her, and said: ""they are coming to thee from the king to wreck thy house and to bring thee to him perforce. and thou wilt be pregnant by me, and bear a son, and that son must not kill birds. and 'conaire, son of mess buachalla' shall be his name,"" for hers was mess buachalla, ""the cowherds' fosterchild."" nl  nl and then she was brought to the king, and with her went her fosterers, and she was betrothed to the king, and he gave her seven cumals and to her fosterers seven other cumals. and afterwards they were made chieftains, so that they all became legitimate, whence are the two fedlimthi rechtaidi. and then she bore a son to the king, even conaire son of mess buachalla, and these were her three urgent prayers to the king, to wit, the nursing of her son among three households, that is, the fosterers who had nurtured her, and the two honeyworded mainès, and she herself is the third; and she said that such of the men of erin as should wish to do aught for this boy should give to those three households for the boy's protection. nl so in that wise he was reared, and the men of erin straightway knew this boy on the day he was born. and other boys were fostered with him, to wit, fer le and fer gar and fer rogein, three great-grandsons of donn désa the champion, an army-man of the army from muc-lesi. nl now conaire possessed three gifts, to wit, the gift of hearing and the gift of eyesight and the gift of judgment; and of those three gifts he taught one to each of his three foster-brothers. and whatever meal was prepared for him, the four of them would go to it. even though three meals were prepared for him each of them would go to his meal. the same raiment and armour and colour of horses had the four. nl then the king, even eterscéle, died. a bull-feast is gathered by the men of erin, in order to determine their future king; that is, a bull used to be killed by them and thereof one man would eat his fill and drink its broth, and a spell of truth was chanted over him in his bed. whosoever he would see in his sleep would be king, and the sleeper would perish if he uttered a falsehood. nl four men in chariots were on the plain of liffey at their game, conaire himself and his three foster-brothers. then his fosterers went to him that he might repair to the bullfeast. the bull-feaster, then in his sleep, at the end of the night beheld a man stark-naked, passing along the road of tara, with a stone in his sling. nl ""i will go in the morning after you,"" quoth he. nl he left his foster-brothers at their game, and turned his chariot and his charioteer until he was in dublin. there he saw great, white-speckled birds, of unusual size and colour and beauty. he pursues them until his horses were tired. the birds would go a spearcast before him, and would not go any further. he alighted, and takes his sling for them out of the chariot. he goes after them until he was at the sea. the birds betake themselves to the wave. he went to them and overcame them. the birds quit their birdskins, and turn upon him with spears and swords. one of them protects him, and addressed him, saying: ""i am némglan, king of thy father's birds; and thou hast been forbidden to cast at birds, for here there is no one that should not be dear to thee because of his father or mother."" nl ""till today,"" says conaire, ""i knew not this."" nl ""go to tara tonight,"" says némglan; ""'tis fittest for thee. a bull feast is there, and through it thou shalt be king. a man stark-naked, who shall go at the end of the night along one of the roads of tara, having a stone and a sling--'tis he that shall be king."" nl so in this wise conaire fared forth; and on each of the four roads whereby men go to tara there were three kings awaiting him, and they had raiment for him, since it had been foretold that he would come stark-naked. then he was seen from the road on which his fosterers were, and they put royal raiment about him, and placed him in a chariot, and he bound his pledges. nl the folk of tara said to him: ""it seems to us that our bullfeast and our spell of truth are a failure, if it be only a young, beardless lad that we have visioned therein."" nl ""that is of no moment,"" quoth he. ""for a young, generous king like me to be in the kingship is no disgrace, since the binding of tara's pledges is mine by right of father and grandsire."" nl ""excellent! excellent!"" says the host. they set the kingship of erin upon him. and he said: ""i will enquire of wise men that i myself may be wise."" nl then he uttered all this as he had been taught by the man at the wave, who said this to him: ""thy reign will be subject to a restriction, but the bird-reign will be noble, and this shall be thy restriction, i. e. thy tabu. nl ""thou shalt not go righthandwise round tara and lefthandwise round bregia. nl ""the evil-beasts of cerna must not be hunted by thee. nl ""and thou shalt not go out every ninth night beyond tara. nl ""thou shalt not sleep in a house from which firelight is manifest outside, after sunset, and in which light is manifest from without. nl ""and three reds shall not go before thee to red's house. nl ""and no rapine shall be wrought in thy reign. nl ""and after sunset a company of one woman or one man shall not enter the house in which thou art. nl ""and thou shalt not settle the quarrel of thy two thralls. nl now there were in his reign great bounties, to wit, seven ships in every june in every year arriving at inver colptha, and oakmast up to the knees in every autumn, and plenty of fish in the rivers bush and boyne in the june of each year, and such abundance of good will that no one slew another in erin during his reign. and to every one in erin his fellow's voice seemed as sweet as the strings of lutes. from mid-spring to mid-autumn no wind disturbed a cow's tail. his reign was neither thunderous nor stormy. nl  nl now his foster-brothers murmured at the taking from them of their father's and their grandsire's gifts, namely theft and robbery and slaughter of men and rapine. they thieved the three thefts from the same man, to wit, a swine and an ox and a cow, every year, that they might see what punishment therefor the king would inflict upon them, and what damage the theft in his reign would cause to the king. nl now every year the farmer would come to the king to complain, and the king would say to him. ""go thou and address donn désá's three great grandsons, for 'tis they that have taken the beasts."" whenever he went to speak to donn désá's descendants they would almost kill him, and he would not return to the king lest conaire should attend his hurt. nl since, then, pride and wilfulness possessed them, they took to marauding, surrounded by the sons of the lords of the men of erin. thrice fifty men had they as pupils when they (the pupils) were were-wolfing in the province of connaught, until maine milscothach's swineherd saw them, and he had never seen that before. he went in flight. when they heard him they pursued him. the swineherd shouted, and the people of the two mainès came to him, and the thrice fifty men were arrested, along with their auxiliaries, and taken to tara. they consulted the king concerning the matter, and he said: ""let each (father) slay his son, but let my fosterlings be spared."" nl ""leave, leave!"" says every one: ""it shall be done for thee."" nl ""nay indeed,"" quoth he; ""no 'cast of life' by me is the doom i have delivered. the men shall not be hung; but let veterans go with them that they may wreak their rapine on the men of alba."" nl this they do. thence they put to sea and met the son of the king of britain, even ingcél the one-eyed, grandson of conmac: thrice fifty men and their veterans they met upon the sea. nl they make an alliance, and go with ingcél and wrought rapine with him. nl this is the destruction which his own impulse gave him. that was the night that his mother and his father and his seven brothers had been bidden to the house of the king of his district. all of them were destroyed by ingcél in a single night. then the irish pirates put out to sea to the land of erin to seek a destruction as payment for that to which ingcél had been entitled from them. nl in conaire's reign there was perfect peace in erin, save that in thomond there was a joining of battle between the two carbres. two foster-brothers of his were they. and until conaire came it was impossible to make peace between them. 'twas a tabu of his to go to separate them before they had repaired to him. he went, however, although to do so was one of his tabus, and he made peace between them. he remained five nights with each of the two. that also was a tabu of his. nl after settling the two quarrels, he was travelling to tara. this is the way they took to tara, past usnech of meath; and they saw the raiding from east and west, and from south and north, and they saw the warbands and the hosts, and the men stark-naked; and the land of the southern o'neills was a cloud of fire around him. nl ""what is this?"" asked conaire. ""easy to say,"" his people answer. ""easy to know that the king's law has broken down therein, since the country has begun to burn."" nl ""whither shall we betake ourselves?"" says conaire. nl ""to the northeast,"" says his people. nl so then they went righthandwise round tara, and lefthandwise round bregia, and the evil beasts of cerna were hunted by him. but he saw it not till the chase had ended. nl they that made of the world that smoky mist of magic were elves, and they did so because conaire's tabus had been violated. nl great fear then fell on conaire because they had no way to wend save upon the road of midluachair and the road of cuálu. nl so they took their way by the coast of ireland southward. nl then said conaire on the road of cuálu: ""whither shall we go tonight?"" nl ""may i succeed in telling thee! my fosterling conaire,"" says mac cecht, son of snade teiched, the champion of conaire, son of eterscél. ""oftener have the men of erin been contending for thee every night than thou hast been wandering about for a guesthouse."" nl ""judgment goes with good times,"" says conaire. ""i had a friend in this country, if only we knew the way to his house!"" nl ""what is his name?"" asked mac cecht. nl ""dá derga of leinster,"" answered conaire. ""he came unto me to seek a gift from me, and he did not come with a refusal. i gave him a hundred kine of the drove. i gave him a hundred fatted swine. i gave him a hundred mantles made of close cloth. i gave him a hundred blue-coloured weapons of battle. i gave him ten red, gilded brooches. i gave him ten vats good and brown. i gave him ten thralls. i gave him ten querns. i gave him thrice nine hounds all-white in their silvern chains. i gave him a hundred race-horses in the herds of deer. there would be no abatement in his case though he should come again. he would make return. it is strange if he is surly to me tonight when reaching his abode."" nl ""when i was acquainted with his house,"" says mac cecht, ""the road whereon thou art going towards him was the boundary of his abode. it continues till it enters his house, for through the house passes the road. there are seven doorways into the house, and seven bedrooms between every two doorways; but there is only one doorvalve on it, and that valve is turned to every doorway to which the wind blows."" nl ""with all that thou hast here,"" says conaire, ""thou shalt go in thy great multitude until thou alight in the midst of the house."" nl ""if so be,"" answers mac cecht, ""that thou goest thither, i go on that i may strike fire there ahead of thee."" nl when conaire after this was journeying along the road of cuálu, he marked before him three horsemen riding towards the house. three red frocks had they, and three red mantles: three red bucklers they bore, and three red spears were in their hands: three red steeds they bestrode, and three red heads of hair were on them. red were they all, both body and hair and raiment, both steeds and men. nl ""who is it that fares before us?"" asked conaire. ""it was a tabu of mine for those three to go before me--the three reds to the house of red. who will follow them and tell them to come towards me in my track?"" nl ""i will follow them,"" says lé fri flaith, conaire's son. nl he goes after them, lashing his horse, and overtook them not. there was the length of a spearcast between them: but they did not gain upon him and he did not gain upon them. nl he told them not to go before the king. he overtook them not; but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder: nl ""lo, my son, great the news, news from a hostel . . . lo, my son!"" nl they go away from him then: he could not detain them. nl the boy waited for the host. he told his father what was said to him. conaire liked it not. ""after them, thou!"" says conaire, ""and offer them three oxen and three bacon-pigs, and so long as they shall be in my household, no one shall be among them from fire to wall."" nl so the lad goes after them, and offers them that, and overtook them not. but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder: nl ""lo, my son, great the news! a generous king's great ardour whets thee, burns thee. through ancient men's enchantments a company of nine yields. lo, my son!"" nl the boy turns back and repeated the lay to conaire. nl ""go after them,"" says conaire, ""and offer them six oxen and six bacon pigs, and my leavings, and gifts tomorrow, and so long as they shall be in my household no one to be among them from fire to wall."" nl the lad then went after them, and overtook them not; but one of the three men answered and said: nl ""lo, my son, great the news. weary are the steeds we ride. we ride the steeds of donn tetscorach from the elfmounds. though we are alive we are dead. great are the signs: destruction of life: sating of ravens: feeding of crows, strife of slaughter: wetting of sword-edge, shields with broken bosses in hours after sundown. lo, my son!"" nl then they go from him. nl ""i see that thou hast not detained the men,"" says conaire. nl ""indeed it is not i that betrayed it,"" says lé fri flaith. nl he recited the last answer that they gave him. conaire and his retainers were not blithe thereat: and afterwards evil forebodings of terror were on them. nl ""all my tabus have seized me tonight,"" says conaire, ""since those three reds are the banished folks."" nl  nl they went forward to the house and took their seats therein, and fastened their red steeds to the door of the house. nl that is the forefaring of the three reds in the bruden dá derga. nl this is the way that conaire took with his troops, to dublin. nl  nl conaire and his troops to dublin nl 'tis then the man of the black, cropt hair, with his one hand and one eye and one foot, overtook them. rough cropt hair upon him. though a sackful of wild apples were flung on his crown, not an apple would fall on the ground, but each of them would stick on his hair. though his snout were flung on a branch they would remain together. long and thick as an outer yoke was each of his two shins. each of his buttocks was the size of a cheese on a withe. a forked pole of iron black-pointed was in his hand. a swine, black-bristled, singed, was on his back, squealing continually, and a woman big-mouthed, huge, dark, sorry, hideous, was behind him. though her snout were flung on a branch, the branch would support it. her lower lip would reach her knee. nl he starts forward to meet conaire, and made him welcome. ""welcome to thee, o master conaire! long hath thy coming hither been known."" nl ""who gives the welcome?"" asks conaire. nl ""fer caille here, with his black swine for thee to consume that thou be not fasting tonight, for 'tis thou art the best king that has come into the world!"" nl ""what is thy wife's name?"" says conaire. nl ""cichuil,"" he answers. nl ""any other night,"" says conaire, ""that pleases you, i will come to you,--and leave us alone tonight."" nl ""nay,"" say the churl, ""for we will go to thee to the place wherein thou wilt be tonight, o fair little master conaire!"" nl so he goes towards the house, with his great, big-mouthed wife behind him, and his swine short-bristled, black, singed, squealing continually, on his back. that was one of conaire's tabus, and that plunder should be taken in ireland during his reign was another tabu of his. nl now plunder was taken by the sons of donn désa, and five hundred there were in the body of their marauders, besides what underlings were with them. this, too, was a tabu of conaire's. there was a good warrior in the north country, ""wain over withered sticks,"" this was his name. why he was so called was because he used to go over his opponent even as a wain would go over withered sticks. now plunder was taken by him, and there were five hundred in the body of their marauders alone, besides underlings. nl there was after that a troop of still haughtier heroes, namely, the seven sons of ailill and medb, each of whom was called ""manè."" and each manè had a nickname, to wit, manè fatherlike and manè motherlike, and manè gentle-pious, manè very-pious, manè unslow, and manè honeyworded, manè grasp-them-all, and manè the loquacious. rapine was wrought by them. as to manè motherlike and manè unslow there were fourteen score in the body of their marauders. manè fatherlike had three hundred and fifty. manè honeyworded had five hundred. manè grasp-them-all had seven hundred. manè the loquacious had seven hundred. each of the others had five hundred in the body of his marauders. nl there was a valiant trio of the men of cúalu of leinster, namely, the three red hounds of cualu, called cethach and clothach and conall. now rapine was wrought by them, and twelve score were in the body of their marauders, and they had a troop of madmen. in conaire's reign a third of the men of ireland were reavers. he was of sufficient strength and power to drive them out of the land of erin so as to transfer their marauding to the other side (great britain), but after this transfer they returned to their country. nl when they had reached the shoulder of the sea, they meet ingcél the one eyed and eiccel and tulchinne, three great-grandsons of conmac of britain, on the raging of the sea. a man ungentle, huge, fearful, uncouth was ingcél. a single eye in his head, as broad as an oxhide, as black as a chafer, with three pupils therein. thirteen hundred were in the body of his marauders. the marauders of the men of erin were more numerous than they. nl they go for a sea-encounter on the main. ""ye should not do this,"" says ingcél: ""do not break the truth of men (fair play) upon us, for ye are more in number than i."" nl ""nought but a combat on equal terms shall befall thee,"" say the reavers of erin. nl ""there is somewhat better for you,"" quoth ingcél. ""let us make peace since ye have been cast out of the land of erin, and we have been cast out of the land of alba and britain. let us make an agreement between us. come ye and wreak your rapine in my country, and i will go with you and wreak my rapine in your country."" nl they follow this counsel, and they gave pledges therefor from this side and from that. there are the sureties that were given to ingcél by the men of erin, namely, fer gair and gabur (or fer lee) and fer rogain, for the destruction that ingcél should choose to cause in ireland and for the destruction that the sons of donn désa should choose in alba and britain. nl a lot was cast upon them to see with which of them they should go first. it fell that they should go with ingcél to his country. so they made for britain, and there his father and mother and his seven brothers were slain, as we have said before. thereafter they made for alba, and there they wrought the destruction, and then they returned to erin. nl 'tis then, now, that conaire son of eterscél went towards the hostel along the road of cualu. nl 'tis then that the reavers came till they were in the sea off the coast of bregia overagainst howth. nl then said the reavers: ""strike the sails, and make one band of you on the sea that ye may not be sighted from land; and let some lightfoot be found from among you to go on shore to see if we could save our honors with ingcél. a destruction for the destruction he has given us."" nl ""who will go on shore to listen? let some one ago,"" says ingcél, ""who should have there the three gifts, namely, gift of hearing, gift of far sight, and gift of judgment."" nl ""i,"" says manè honeyworded, ""have the gift of hearing."" nl ""and i,"" says manè unslow, ""have the gift of far sight and of judgment."" nl ""'tis well for you to go thus,"" say the reavers: ""good is that wise."" nl then nine men go on till they were on the hill of howth, to know what they might hear and see. nl ""be still a while!"" says manè honeyworded. nl ""what is that?"" asks manè unslow. nl ""the sound of a good king's cavalcade i hear."" nl ""by the gift of far sight, i see,"" quoth his comrade. nl ""what seest thou here?"" nl ""i see there,"" quoth he, ""cavalcades splendid, lofty, beautiful, warlike, foreign, somewhat slender, weary, active, keen, whetted, vehement, a good course that shakes a great covering of land. they fare to many heights, with wondrous waters and invers."" nl  nl ""what are the waters and heights and invers that they traverse?"" nl ""easy to say: indéoin, cult, cuiltén, máfat, ammat, iarmáfat, finne, goiste, guistíne. gray spears over chariots: ivory-hilted swords on thighs: silvery shields above their elbows. half red and half white. garments of every color about them. nl ""thereafter i see before them special cattle specially keen, to wit, thrice fifty dark-gray steeds. small-headed are they, red-nosed, pointed, broad-hoofed, big-nosed, red-chested, fat, easily-stopt, easily-yoked, foray-nimble, keen, whetted, vehement, with their thrice fifty bridles of red enamel upon them."" nl ""i swear by what my tribe swears,"" says the man of the long sight, ""these are the cattle of some good lord. this is my judgment thereof: it is conaire, son of eterscél, with multitudes of the men of erin around him, who has travelled the road."" nl back then they go that they may tell it to the reavers.

nl the woman seized it by the tail, and dragged it out of the wound, and it takes the full of its jaws out of him. nl ""truly,"" says the woman, ""this is 'an ant of ancient land.'"" nl says mac cecht ""i swear to god what my people swears, i deemed it no bigger than a fly, or a gnat, or an ant."" nl and mac cecht took the wolf by the throat, and struck it a blow on the forehead, and killed it with a single blow. nl then lé fri flaith, son of conaire, died under mac cecht's armpit, for the warrior's heat and sweat had dissolved him. nl thereafter mac cecht, having cleansed the slaughter, at the end of the third day, set forth, and he dragged conaire with him on his back, and buried him at tara, as some say. then mac cecht departed into connaught, to his own country, that he might work his cure in mag bréngair. wherefore the name clave to the plain from mac cecht's misery, that is, mag brén-guir. nl now conall cernach escaped from the hostel, and thrice fifty spears had gone through the arm which upheld his shield. he fared forth till he reached his father's house, with half his shield in his hand, and his sword, and the fragments of his two spears. then he found his father before his garth in taltiu. nl ""swift are the wolves that have hunted thee, my son,"" saith his father. nl ""'tis this that has wounded us, thou old hero, an evil conflict with warriors,"" conall cernach replied. nl ""hast thou then news of dá derga's hostel?"" asked amorgin. ""is thy lord alive?"" nl ""he is not alive,"" says conall. nl ""i swear to god what the great tribes of ulaid swear, it is cowardly for the man who went thereout alive, having left his lord with his foes in death."" nl ""my wounds are not white, thou old hero,"" says conall. nl he shews him his shield-arm, whereon were thrice fifty wounds: this is what was inflicted upon it. the shield that guarded it is what saved it. but the right arm had been played upon, as far as two thirds thereof, since the shield had not been guarding it. that arm was mangled and maimed and wounded and pierced, save that the sinews kept it to the body without separation. nl ""that arm fought tonight, may son,"" says amorgein. nl ""true is that, thou old hero,"" says conall cernach. ""many there are unto whom it gave drinks of death tonight in front of the hostel."" nl now as to the reavers, every one of them that escaped from the hostel went to the cairn which they had built on the night before last, and they brought thereout a stone for each man not mortally wounded. so this is what they lost by death at the hostel, a man for every stone that is (now) in carn lecca. nl  nl it endeth: amen: it endeth"

10,Soul Food Horns,Oak,"pythagoras comes to the city of crotona, and teaches the principles of his philosophy. his reputation draws numa pompilius to hear his discourses; on which he expounds his principles, and, more especially, enlarges on the transmigration of the soul, and the practice of eating animal food. nl there was a man, a samian by birth; but he had fled from both samos and its rulers,8 and, through hatred of tyranny, he was a voluntary exile. he too, mentally, held converse with the gods, although far distant in the region of the heavens; and what nature refused to human vision, he viewed with the eyes of his mind. and when he had examined all things with his mind, and with watchful study, he gave them to be learned by the public; and he sought the crowds of people as they sat in silence, and wondered at the revealed origin of the vast universe, and the cause of things, and what nature meant, and what was god; whence came the snow, what was the cause of lightning; whether it was jupiter, or whether the winds that thundered when the cloud was rent asunder; what it was that shook the earth; by what laws the stars took their course; and whatever besides lay concealed from mortals. nl he, too, was the first to forbid animals to be served up at table, and he was the first that opened his lips, learned indeed, but still not obtaining credit, in such words as these: “forbear, mortals, to pollute your bodies with such abominable food. there is the corn; there are the apples that bear down the branches by their weight, and there are the grapes swelling upon the vines; there are the herbs that are pleasant; there are some that can become tender, and be softened by the action of fire. the flowing milk, too, is not denied you, nor honey redolent of the bloom of the thyme. the lavish earth yields her riches, and her agreable food, and affords dainties without slaughter and bloodshed. the beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh; and yet not all of them; for the horse, and the sheep, and the herds subsist on grass. nl but those whose disposition is cruel and fierce, the armenian tigers, and the raging lions, and the bears together with the wolves, revel in their diet with blood. alas! what a crime is it, for entrails to be buried in entrails, and for one ravening body to grow fat on other carcases crammed into it; and for one living creature to exist through the death of another living creature! and does, forsooth! amid so great an abundance, which the earth, that best of mothers, produces, nothing delight you but to gnaw with savage teeth the sad produce of your wounds, and to revive the habits of the cyclops? and can you not appease the hunger of a voracious and ill-regulated stomach unless you first destroy another? but that age of old, to which we have given the name of ‘golden,’ was blest in the produce of the trees, and in the herbs which the earth produces, and it did not pollute the mouth with blood. nl “then, both did the birds move their wings in safety in the air, and the hare without fear wander in the midst of the fields; then its own credulity had not suspended the fish from the hook; every place was without treachery, and in dread of no injury, and was full of peace. afterwards, some one, no good adviser9 (whoever among mortals he might have been), envied this simple food, and engulphed in his greedy paunch victuals made from a carcase; ’twas he that opened the path to wickedness; and i can believe that the steel, since stained with blood, first grew warm from the slaughter of wild beasts. and that had been sufficient. i confess that the bodies of animals that seek our destruction are put to death with no breach of the sacred laws; but, although they might be put to death, yet they were not to be eaten as well. then this wickedness proceeded still further; and the swine is believed to have deserved death as the first victim, because it grubbed up the seeds with its turned-up snout, and cut short the hopes of the year. having gnawed the vine, the goat was led10 for slaughter to the altars of the avenging bacchus. their own faults were the ruin of the two. but why have you deserved this, ye sheep? a harmless breed, and born for the service of man; who carry the nectar in your full udders; who afford your wool as soft coverings for us, and who assist us more by your life than by your death. why have the oxen deserved this, an animal without guile and deceit, innocent, harmless, born to endure labour? in fact, the man is ungrateful, and not worthy of the gifts of the harvest, who could, just after taking off the weight of the curving plough, slaughter the tiller of his fields; who could strike, with the axe, that neck worn bare with labour, through which he had so oft turned up the hard ground, and had afforded so many a harvest. nl “and it is not enough for such wickedness to be committed; they have imputed to the gods themselves this abomination; and they believe that a deity in the heavens can rejoice in the slaughter of the laborious ox. a victim free from a blemish, and most beauteous in form (for ’tis being sightly that brings destruction), adorned with garlands and gold, is placed upon the altars, and, in its ignorance, it hears one praying, and sees the corn, which it has helped to produce, placed on its forehead between its horns; and, felled, it stains with its blood the knives perhaps before seen by it in the limpid water. immediately, they examine the entrails snatched from its throbbing breast, and in them they seek out the intentions of the deities. whence comes it that men have so great a hankering for forbidden food? do you presume to feed on flesh, o race of mortals? do it not, i beseech you; and give attention to my exhortations. and when you shall be presenting the limbs of slaughtered oxen to your palates, know and consider that you are devouring your tillers of the ground. and since a god impels me to speak, i will duly obey the god that so prompts me to speak; and i will pronounce my own delphic warnings, and disclose the heavens themselves; and i will reveal the oracles of the divine will. i will sing of wondrous things, never investigated by the intellects of the ancients, and things which have long lain concealed. it delights me to range among the lofty stars; it delights me, having left the earth and this sluggish spot far behind, to be borne amid the clouds, and to be supported on the shoulders of the mighty atlas; and to look down from afar on minds wandering in uncertainty, and devoid of reason; and so to advise them alarmed and dreading extinction, and to unfold the range of things ordained by fate. nl “o race! stricken by the alarms of icy death, why do you dread styx? why the shades, why empty names, the stock subjects of the poets, and the atonements of an imaginary world? whether the funeral pile consumes your bodies with flames, or old age with gradual dissolution, believe that they cannot suffer any injury. souls are not subject to death; and having left their former abode, they ever inhabit new dwellings, and, there received, live on. nl “i, myself, for i remember it, in the days of the trojan war, was euphorbus,11 the son of panthoüs, in whose opposing breast once was planted the heavy spear of the younger son of atreus. i lately recognised the shield, once the burden of my left arm, in the temple of juno, at argos, the realm of abas. all things are ever changing; nothing perishes. the soul wanders about and comes from that spot to this, from this to that, and takes possession of any limbs whatever; it both passes from the beasts to human bodies, and so does our soul into the beasts; and in no lapse of time does it perish. and as the pliable wax is moulded into new forms, and no longer abides as it was before, nor preserves the same shape, but yet is still the same wax, so i tell you that the soul is ever the same, but passes into different forms. therefore, that natural affection may not be vanquished by the craving of the appetite, cease, i warn you, to expel the souls of your kindred from their bodies by this dreadful slaughter; and let not blood be nourished with blood. nl “and, since i am now borne over the wide ocean, and i have given my full sails to the winds, there is nothing in all the world that continues in the same state. all things are flowing onward,12 and every shape is assumed in a fleeting course. even time itself glides on with a constant progress, no otherwise than a river. for neither can the river, nor the fleeting hour stop in its course; but, as wave is impelled by wave, and the one before is pressed on by that which follows, and itself presses on that before it; so do the moments similarly fly on, and similarly do they follow, and they are ever renewed. for the moment which was before, is past; and that which was not, now exists; and every minute is replaced. you see, too, the night emerge and proceed onward to the dawn, and this brilliant light of the day succeed the dark night. nor is there the same appearance in the heavens, when all things in their weariness lie in the midst of repose, and when lucifer is coming forth on his white steed; and, again, there is another appearance, when aurora, the daughter of pallas, preceding the day, tints the world about to be delivered to phœbus. the disk itself of that god, when it is rising from beneath the earth, is of ruddy colour in the morning, and when it is hiding beneath the earth it is of a ruddy colour. at its height it is of brilliant whiteness, because there the nature of the æther is purer, and far away, he avoids all infection from the earth. nor can there ever be the same or a similar appearance of the nocturnal diana; and always that of the present day is less than on the morrow, if she is on the increase; but greater if she is contracting her orb. nl “and further. do you not see the year, affording a resemblance of our life, assume four different appearances? for, in early spring, it is mild, and like a nursling, and greatly resembling the age of youth. then, the blade is shooting, and void of strength, it swells, and is flaccid, and delights the husbandman in his expectations. then, all things are in blossom, and the genial meadow smiles with the tints of its flowers; and not as yet is there any vigour in the leaves. the year now waxing stronger, after the spring, passes into the summer; and in its youth it becomes robust. and indeed no season is there more vigorous, or more fruitful, or which glows with greater warmth. autumn follows, the ardour of youth now removed, ripe, and placed between youth and old age, moderate in his temperature, with a few white hairs sprinkled over his temples. then comes aged winter, repulsive with his tremulous steps, either stript of his locks, or white with those which he has. nl “our own bodies too are changing always and without any intermission, and to-morrow we shall not be what we were or what we now are. the time was, when only as embryos, and the earliest hope of human beings, we lived in the womb of the mother. nature applied her skilful hands, and willed not that our bodies should be tortured by being shut up within the entrails of the distended parent, and brought us forth from our dwelling into the vacant air. brought to light, the infant lies without any strength; soon, like a quadruped, it uses its limbs after the manner of the brutes; and by degrees it stands upright, shaking, and with knees still unsteady, the sinews being supported by some assistance. then he becomes strong and swift, and passes over the hours of youth; and the years of middle age, too, now past, he glides adown the steep path of declining age. this undermines and destroys the robustness of former years; and milo,13 now grown old, weeps when he sees the arms, which equalled those of hercules in the massiveness of the solid muscles, hang weak and exhausted. the daughter of tyndarus weeps, too, as she beholds in her mirror the wrinkles of old age, and enquires of herself why it is that she was twice ravished. thou, time, the consumer of all things, and thou, hateful old age, together destroy all things; and, by degrees ye consume each thing, decayed by the teeth of age, with a slow death. nl “these things too, which we call elements, are not of unchanging duration; pay attention, and i will teach you what changes they undergo. nl “the everlasting universe contains four elementary bodies. two of these, namely, earth and water, are heavy, and are borne downwards by their weight; and as many are devoid of weight, and air, and fire still purer than air, nothing pressing them, seek the higher regions. although these are separated in space, yet all things are made from them, and are resolved into them. both the earth dissolving distils into flowing water; the water, too, evaporating, departs in the breezes and the air; its weight being removed again, the most subtle air shoots upwards into the fires of the æther on high. thence do they return back again, and the same order is unravelled; for fire becoming gross, passes into dense air; this changes into water, and earth is formed of the water made dense. nor does its own form remain to each; and nature, the renewer of all things, re-forms one shape from another. and, believe me, in this universe so vast, nothing perishes; but it varies and changes its appearance; and to begin to be something different from what it was before, is called being born; and to cease to be the same thing, is to be said to die. whereas, perhaps, those things are transferred hither, and these things thither; yet, in the whole, all things ever exist. nl “for my part, i cannot believe that anything lasts long under the same form. ’twas thus, ye ages, that ye came down to the iron from the gold; ’tis thus, that thou hast so often changed the lot of various places. i have beheld that as sea, which once had been the most solid earth. i have seen land made from the sea; and far away from the ocean the sea-shells lay, and old anchors were found there on the tops of the mountains. that which was a plain, a current of water has made into a valley, and by a flood the mountain has been levelled into a plain; the ground that was swampy is parched with dry sand; and places which have endured drought, are wet with standing pools. here nature has opened fresh springs, but there she has shut them up; and rivers have burst forth, aroused by ancient earthquakes; or, vanishing, they have subsided. nl “thus, after the lycus14 has been swallowed up by a chasm in the earth, it burst forth far thence, and springs up afresh at another mouth. thus the great erasinus15 is at one time swallowed up, and then flowing with its stream concealed, is cast up again on the argive plains. they say, too, that the mysus, tired of its spring and of its former banks, now flows in another direction, as the caicus. the amenanus,16 too, at one time flows, rolling along the sicilian sands, and at another is dry, its springs being stopped up. formerly, the water of the anigros17 was used for drinking; it now pours out water which you would decline to touch; since, (unless all credit must be denied to the poets), the centaurs, the double-limbed mortals, there washed the wounds which the bow of the club-bearing hercules had made. and what besides? does not the hypanis18 too, which before was sweet, rising from the scythian mountains, become impregnated with bitter salts? antissa,19 pharos,20 and phœnician tyre,21 were once surrounded by waves; no one of these is now an island. the ancient inhabitants had leucas22 annexed to the continent; now the sea surrounds it. zancle,23 too, is said to have been united to italy, until the sea cut off the neighbouring region, and repelled the land with its waves flowing between. nl “should you seek helice and buris,24 cities of achaia, you will find them beneath the waves, and the sailors are still won't to point out these levelled towns, with their walls buried under water. nl “there is a high hill near trœzen of pittheus, without any trees, once a very level surface of a plain, but now a hill; for (frightful to tell) the raging power25 of the winds, pent up in dark caverns, desiring to find some vent and having long struggled in vain to enjoy a freer air, as there was no opening in all their prison and it was not pervious to their blasts, swelled out the extended earth, just as the breath of the mouth is won't to inflate a bladder, or the hide26 stripped from the two-horned goat. that swelling remained on the spot, and still preserves the appearance of a high hill, and has grown hard in length of time. though many other instances may occur, either heard of by, or known to, yourselves, yet i will mention a few more. and besides, does not water, as well, both produce and receive new forms? in the middle of the day, thy waters, horned ammon,27 are frozen, at the rising and at the setting of the sun they are warm. on applying its waters, athamanis28 is said to kindle wood when the waning moon has shrunk into her smallest orb. the ciconians have a river,29 which when drunk of, turns the entrails into stone, and lays a covering of marble on things that are touched by it. the crathis30 and the sybaris adjacent to it, in our own country, make the hair similar in hue to amber and gold. nl “and, what is still more wonderful, there are some streams which are able to change, not only bodies, but even the mind. by whom has not salmacis,31 with its obscene waters, been heard of? who has not heard, too, of that lake of æthiopia,32 of which, if any body drinks with his mouth, he either becomes mad, or falls into a sleep wondrous for its heaviness? whoever quenches his thirst from the clitorian spring33 hates wine, and in his sobriety takes pleasure in pure water. whether it is that there is a virtue in the water, the opposite of heating wine, or whether, as the natives tell us, after the son of amithaon,34 by his charms and his herbs, had delivered the raving daughters of prœtus from the furies, he threw the medicines for the mind in that stream; and a hatred of wine remained in those waters. nl “the river lyncestis35 flows unlike that stream in its effect; for as soon as any one has drunk of it with immoderate throat, he reels, just as if he had been drinking unmixed wine. there is a place in arcadia, (the ancients called it pheneos,)36 suspicious for the twofold nature of its water. stand in dread of it at night; if drunk of in the night time, it is injurious; in the daytime, it is drunk of without any ill effects. so lakes and rivers have, some, one property, and some another. there was a time when ortygia37 was floating on the waves, now it is fixed. the argo dreaded the symplegades tossed by the assaults of the waves dashing against them; they now stand immoveable, and resist the attacks of the winds. nl “nor will ætna, which burns with its sulphureous furnaces, always be a fiery mountain; nor yet was it always fiery. for, if the earth is an animal, and is alive, and has lungs that breathe forth flames in many a place, it may change the passages for its breathing, and oft as it is moved, may close these caverns and open others; or if the light winds are shut up in its lowermost caverns, and strike rocks against rocks, and matter that contains the elements of flame, and it takes fire at the concussion, the winds once calmed, the caverns will become cool; or, if the bituminous qualities take fire, or yellow sulphur is being dried up with a smouldering smoke, still, when the earth shall no longer give food and unctuous fuel to the flame, its energies being exhausted in length of time, and when nutriment shall be wanting to its devouring nature, it will not be able to endure hunger, and left destitute, it will desert its flames. nl “the story is, that in the far northern pallene38 there are persons, who are won't to have their bodies covered with light feathers, when they have nine times entered the tritonian lake. for my part i do not believe it; but the scythian women, as well, having their limbs sprinkled with poison, are said to employ the same arts. but if we are to give any credit39 to things proved by experience, do you not see that whatever bodies are consumed by length of time, or by dissolving heat, are changed into small animals? come too, bury some choice bullocks just slain, it is a thing well ascertained by experience, that flower-gathering bees are produced promiscuously from the putrefying entrails. these, after the manner of their producers, inhabit the fields, delight in toil, and labour in hope. the warlike steed,40 buried in the ground, is the source of the hornet. if you take off the bending claws from the crab of the sea-shore, and bury the rest in the earth, a scorpion will come forth from the part so buried, and will threaten with its crooked tail. nl “the silkworms, too, that are won't to cover the leaves with their white threads, a thing observable by husbandmen, change their forms into that of the deadly moth.41 mud contains seed that generate green frogs; and it produces them deprived of feet;42 soon it gives them legs adapted for swimming; and that the same may be fitted for long leaps, the length of the hinder ones exceeds that of the fore legs. and it is not a cub43 which the bear produces at the moment of birth, but a mass of flesh hardly alive. by licking, the mother forms it into limbs, and brings it into a shape, such as she herself has. do you not see, that the offspring of the honey bees, which the hexagonal cell conceals, are produced without limbs, and that they assume both feet and wings only after a time. unless he knew it was the case, could any one suppose it possible that the bird of juno, which carries stars on its tail, and the eagle, the armour-bearer of jove, and the doves of cytherea, and all the race of birds, are produced from the middle portion of an egg? there are some who believe that human marrow changes into a serpent,44 when the spine has putrefied in the enclosed sepulchre. nl “but these which i have named derive their origin from other particulars; there is one bird which renews and reproduces itself. the assyrians call it the phœnix. it lives not on corn or grass, but on drops of frankincense, and the juices of the amomum. this bird, when it has completed the five ages of its life, with its talons and its crooked beak constructs for itself a nest in the branches of a holm-oak, or on the top of a quivering palm. as soon as it has strewed in this cassia and ears of sweet spikenard and bruised cinnamon with yellow myrrh, it lays itself down on it, and finishes its life in the midst of odours. they say that thence, from the body of its parent, is reproduced a little phœnix, which is destined to live as many years. when time has given it strength, and it is able to bear the weight, it lightens the branches of the lofty tree of the burden of the nest, and dutifully carries both its own cradle and the sepulchre of its parent; and, having reached the city of hyperion through the yielding air, it lays it down before the sacred doors in the temple of hyperion. nl “and if there is any wondrous novelty in these things, still more may we be surprised that the hyæna changes its sex,45 and that the one which has just now, as a female, submitted to the embrace of the male, is now become a male itself. that animal, too, which feeds upon46 the winds and the air, immediately assumes, from its contact, any colour whatever. conquered india presented her lynxes to bacchus crowned with clusters; and, as they tell, whatever the bladder of these discharges is changed into stone,47 and hardens by contact with the air. so coral, too, as soon as it has come up to the air becomes hard; beneath the waves it was a soft plant.48 “the day will fail me, and phœbus will bathe his panting steeds in the deep sea, before i can embrace in my discourse all things that are changed into new forms. so in lapse of time, we see nations change, and these gaining strength, while those are falling. so troy was great, both in her riches and her men, and for ten years could afford so much blood; whereas, now laid low, she only shows her ancient ruins, and, instead of her wealth, she points at the tombs of her ancestors. sparta was famed;49 great mycenæ flourished; so, too, the citadel of cecrops, and that of amphion. now sparta is a contemptible spot; lofty mycenæ is laid low. what now is thebes, the city of œdipus, but a mere story? what remains of athens, the city of pandion, but its name? nl “now, too, there is a report that dardanian rome is rising; which, close to the waters of tiber that rises in the apennines, is laying the foundations of her greatness beneath a vast structure. she then, in her growth, is changing her form, and will one day be the mistress of the boundless earth. so they say that the soothsayers, and the oracles, revealers of destiny, declare; and, so far as i recollect, helenus, the son of priam, said to æneas, as he was lamenting, and in doubt as to his safety, when now the trojan state was sinking, ‘son of a goddess, if thou dost thyself well understand the presentiment of my mind, troy shall not, thou being preserved, entirely fall. the flames and the sword shall afford thee a passage. thou shalt go, and, together with thee, thou shalt bear ruined pergamus; until a foreign soil, more friendly than thy native land, shall be the lot of troy and thyself. even now do i see that our phrygian posterity are destined to build a city, so great as neither now exists, nor will exist, nor has been seen in former times. through a long lapse of ages, other distinguished men shall make it powerful, but one born50 of the blood of iülus shall make it the mistress of the world. after the earth shall have enjoyed his presence, the æthereal abodes shall gain him, and heaven shall be his destination.’ remembering it, i call to mind that helenus prophesied this to æneas, who bore the penates from troy; and i rejoice that my kindred walls are rising apace, and that to such good purpose for the phrygians the pelasgians conquered. nl “but that we may not range afar with steeds that forget to hasten to the goal; the heavens, and whatever there is beneath them, and the earth, and whatever is upon it, change their form. we too, who are a portion of the universe, (since we are not only bodies, but are fleeting souls as well, and can enter into beasts as our abode, and be hidden within the breasts of the cattle), should allow those bodies which may contain the souls of our parents, or of our brothers, or of those allied with us by some tie, or of men at all events, to be safe and unmolested; and we ought not to fill51 our entrails with victuals fit for thyestes. how greatly he disgraces himself, how in his impiety does he prepare himself for shedding human blood, who cuts the throat of the calf with the knife, and gives a deaf ear to its lowings! or who can kill the kid as it sends forth cries like those of a child;

12,Sound Quelle,Melancholy Strings,"                   apology for raimond sebond nl learning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment; and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding; but learning yet i do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do, as herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein places the sovereign good, and maintained ""that it was only in her to render us wise and contented,"" which i do not believe; no more than i do what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required a very long interpretation. my house has long-been open to men of knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which francis the first embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. for my part i love them well, but i do not adore them. amongst others, peter bunel, a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others of his sort, staid some days at montaigne in my father's company, he presented him at his departure with a book, entitled theologia naturalis; sive liber creaturarum, magistri raimondi de sebonde. and as the italian and spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of spanish with latin terminations, he hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it, and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel doctrines of luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger our ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the reverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke: nl            nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum; nl            ""for with most eagerness they spurn the law, nl           by which they were before most kept in awe;"" nl resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent. nl it happened that my father, a little before his death, having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers, commanded me to translate it for him into french. it is good too translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter itself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom. it was a strange and a new undertaking for me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, i did it as well as i could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed, which after his death was done. nl i found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many people take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom we owe the most service, i have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it. his design is bold and daring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish and make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the christian religion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful that i do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, i believe he has been equalled by none. this work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and of whom all that we know is that he was a spaniard, practising physic at toulouse about two hundred years ago; i enquired of adrian turnebus, who knew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, ""that he thought it was some abstract drawn from st. thomas d'aquin; for that, in truth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety, was alone capable of such thoughts."" be this as it may, whoever was the author and inventor (and 'tis not reasonable, without greater certainty, to deprive sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts. nl the first thing they reprehend in his work is ""that christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace."" in which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect. this were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, i conceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased the bounty of god to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. and i do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly furnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed, by their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. 'tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion; but, withal, i do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which god has endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. we do not satisfy ourselves with serving god with our souls and understandings only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our limbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge. if it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover, by human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and yet, i am afraid, we only have it by this way. nl if we hold upon god by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon god by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation, human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy: nl                 as a great rock repels the rolling tides, nl             that foam and bark about her marble sides, nl            from its strong bulk nl if we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear throughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light. we ought to be ashamed that, in all the human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in some measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish christians by the name! will you see the proof of this? compare our manners to those of a mahometan or pagan, you will still find that we fall very nl short; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others: and that it should be said of us, ""are they so just, so charitable, so good: then they are christians."" all other signs are common to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance, nl martyrs. the peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product of truth. for this our good st. louis was in the right, who, when the tartar king, who was become christian, designed to come to lyons to kiss the pope's feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put him out of conceit with so holy a belief! and yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other, who, going to rome, to the same end, and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so vicious hands. if we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove mountains from their places, saith the sacred word; our actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be merely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well as our belief: brevis est institutio vit honest beauque, si credos. ""believe, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one."" some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe. we think it strange if, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is because we bring nothing to it but our own. justice, which is in one party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed, pretended, but 'tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection of the party. god owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion; not to our passions. men there are the conductors, and therein serve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary. observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so direct and firm. when and where was this more manifest than in france in our days? they who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken it on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with a progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. did one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more united, and more the same? do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them, accord—as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms. nl this so solemn proposition, ""whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,"" do you remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? and hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that. we condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does france than say it? let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the army, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d'armes. whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions, and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run full speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness, and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations, according to the variety wherein they move? nl i evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions. nl there hostility so admirable as the christian. our zeal performs wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition, avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair, towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor toot. our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens, nourishes, and incites them. we must not mock god. if we believed in him, i do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say (and i speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions, we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him;—at least, he would go equal in our affection with riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. the best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his kinsman, or his master. is there any understanding so weak that, having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other (in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory, would change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps, the very desire to offend. the philosopher antisthenes, as he was being initiated in the mysteries of orpheus, the priest telling him, ""that those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death,""—""if thou believest that,"" answered he, ""why dost thou not die thyself?"" diogenes, more rudely, according to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest that in like manner preached to him, ""to become of his religion, that he might obtain the happiness of the other world;—""what!"" said he, ""thou wouldest have me to believe that agesilaus and epaminondas, who were so great men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and canst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?"" did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should not have death in so great horror: nl           non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur; nl           sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais, nl          gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus. nl           ""we should not on a death bed grieve to be nl            dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully nl           from our old hut, and with the snake, be glad nl            to cast off the corrupted slough we had; nl           or with th' old stag rejoice to be now clear nl            from the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear."" nl ""i desire to be dissolved,"" we should say, ""and to be with jesus christ"" the force of plato's arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for. nl all this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other religions are received. either we are happened in the country where it is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority of the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. these considerations ought, 'tis true, to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. another religion, other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way, imprint a quite contrary belief. we are christians by the same title that we are perigordians or germans. and what plato says, ""that there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,"" does not concern a true christian: 'tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation. what kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us? a pleasant faith, that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! can a vicious passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product in our souls? ""they are confident in their judgment,"" says he, ""that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!"" and by reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his laws all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. they say of bion that, infected with the atheism of theodoras, he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of bion. plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of god either by reason or by force. atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous, difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how arrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have, nevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples. a doctrine seriously digested is one thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy. miserable and senseless men, who strive to be worse than they can! nl the error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this great soul of plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into this other mistake, ""that children and old men were most susceptible of religion,"" as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness. the knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our reasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint, having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority of god and his divine grace. now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith, 'tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design. neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them. he has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his divinity, and 'tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it. 'tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, ""that he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible."" sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker. it were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the universe consent to our belief. the heavens, the earth, the elements, our bodies and our souls,—all things concur to this; we have but to find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable of instruction. for this world is a sacred temple, into which man is introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal hand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the sun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are intelligible to us. ""the invisible tilings of god,"" says st. paul, ""appear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works."" nl           and god himself envies not men the grace nl           of seeing and admiring heaven's face; nl            but, rolling it about, he still anew nl            presents its varied splendour to our view, nl           and on oar minds himself inculcates, so nl            that we th' almighty mover well may know: nl          instructing us by seeing him the cause nl             of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws."" nl now our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter. the grace of god is the form; 'tis that which gives fashion and value to it. as the virtuous actions of socrates and cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses; they have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and without light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. faith coming to tinct and illustrate sehond's arguments renders them firm and stolid; and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and of being the first guides to an elementary christian to put him into the way of this knowledge. they in some measure form him to, and render him capable of, the grace of god, by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief. i know a man of authority, bred up to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by sebond's arguments. and should they be stripped of this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith, and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion, they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents: nl            si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer: nl                ""if you have arguments more fit. nl             produce them, or to these submit."" nl let them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others, and upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. i am, unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which i proposed to make answer in the behalf of sebond. some say that his arguments are weak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great ease to confute them. these are to be a little more roughly handled, for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. to an atheist all writings tend to atheism: he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom. these have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish sebond's reasons. as to the rest, they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of authority and command, they durst not attack. the means that i shall use, and that i think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the divine majesty. 'tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon:  ""god permits not any being but himself to be truly wise."" let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem dal gratiam. ""god resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."" ""understanding is in the gods,"" says plato, ""and not at all, or very little, in men."" now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted. let us see, then, if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of sebond; that is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason. for st. augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to reproach them with injustice, ""in that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish."" and to show that a great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition. we must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the weakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all one; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its authority and reject its mediation. nl what does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy, when she so often inculcates to us, ""that our wisdom is but folly in the sight of god: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man, who is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and deceive himself."" these sentences of the holy spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which i would maintain that i should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself. nl let us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance, armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his being. let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. let him make me understand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch, the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head, the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience? can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of the world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole? and the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world; who, i wonder, sealed him this patent? let us see his commission for this great employment was it granted in favour of the wise only? few people will be concerned in it. are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst part of the world, to be preferred before the rest?

""how narrow are our understandings!"" are they not dreams of human vanity, to make the moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as plato and plutarch have done? and of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? ""amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of erring, but from a love of error. nl the corruptible body stupifies the soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination."" nl presumption is our natural and original disease. the most wretched and frail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. he feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens under his feet. 'tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to god, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to them portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit how does he know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal motions of animals?—from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? when i play with my cat who knows whether i do not make her more sport than she makes me? we mutually divert one another with our play. if i have my hour to begin or to refus, she also has hers. plato, in his picture of the golden age under saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had, his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life more happily than we could do. need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts? this great author was of opinion that nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time. the defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be in our part as well as theirs? 'tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another,—for we understand them no more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them. 'tis no great wonder if we understand not them, when we do not understand a basque or a troglodyte. and yet some have boasted that they understood them, as apollonius tyanaus, melampus, tiresias, thales, and others. and seeing, as cusmographers report, that there are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions. we must observe the parity betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so have beasts of ours,—much about the same. they caress us, threaten us, and beg of us, and we do the same to them. nl as to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds: nl               ""the tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes. nl           though we of higher race conclude them mutes. nl           yet utter dissonant and various notes, nl           from gentler lungs or more distended throats, nl            as fear, or grief, or anger, do them move, nl           or as they do approach the joys of love."" nl in one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of another sort of bark he is not afraid. even in the very beasts that have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very motions discover it: nl                 ""as infants who, for want of words, devise nl             expressive motions with their hands and eyes."" nl and why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell stories by signs? of whom i have seen some, by practice, so clever and active that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood. lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat, thank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their eyes: nl                ""even silence in a lover nl           love and passion can discover."" nl what with the hands? we require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, pray, supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, admire, number, confess, repent, fear, express confusion, doubt, instruct, command, incite, encourage, swear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, abuse, despise, defy, provoke, flatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt, entertain, congratulate, complain, grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and what not! and all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating speech. nl with the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the lie, welcome, honour, reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject, caress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire. nl what with the eyebrows?—what with the shoulders! there is not a motion that does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline, and a public language that every one understands: whence it should follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that these should rather be judged the property of human nature. i omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need;—the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations that pliny reports have no other language. an ambassador of the city of abdera, after a long conference with agis, king of sparta, demanded of him, ""well, sir, what answer must i return to my fellow-citizens?"" ""that i have given thee leave,"" said he, ""to say what thou wouldest, and as much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word."" is not this a silent speaking, and very easy to be understood? nl as to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals? is there a polity better ordered, the offices better distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that of bees? can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation? nl               ""hence to the bee some sages have assign'd nl            some portion of the god and heavenly wind."" nl the swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? and in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a right angle, without knowing their properties and effects? do they bring water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted? do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy? do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another? why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not deliberation, thought, and conclusion? we sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to imitate them. we see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why do we not conclude the same of them? nl why should we attribute to i know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art? wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of understanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our divine intelligence can do. really, at this rate, we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity is not so irregular and unformed. nl nature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being. for the common complaints i hear men make (as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds, and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks, bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk, according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons, teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and sing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing but weep, without teaching; nl                ""like to the wretched mariner, when toss'd nl          by raging seas upon the desert coast, nl           the tender babe lies naked on the earth, nl          of all supports of life stript by his birth;

nl            and need no arms nor walls their goods to save, nl             since earth and liberal nature ever have, nl           and will, in all abundance, still produce nl          all things whereof they can have need or use:"" nl these complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation. our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes. our ancient gauls were but slenderly clad, any more than the irish, our neighbours, though in so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head, according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us, and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always open, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes half-bare as low as the navel. neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary; and the lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. as to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without instruction; nl ""for every one soon finds his natural force. nl which he, or better may employ, or worse."" nl who doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself, may make shift to find something to eat and the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture and artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts, witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year. the late discovered nations, so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery, may give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that, without tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present, now that we have added our own industry: nl                  ""the earth did first spontaneously afford nl            choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board; nl            with herbs and flow'rs unsown in verdant fields. nl           but scarce by art so good a harvest yields; nl             though men and oxen mutually have strove, nl            with all their utmost force the soil t' improve,"" nl the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it. nl as to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them. those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. if some beasts surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. and the industry of fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by instinct and natural precept? that it is so, the elephant shows who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs them at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon, when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body, and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered slime, as with a cuirass. why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron? nl as to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary. nevertheless i believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would be an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by. and 'tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals: for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing, calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love, which they do with the voice, other than speech? and why should they not speak to one another? they speak to us, and we to them. in how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us? we converse with them in another sort of language, and use other appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the idiom according to the kind. nl                 ""thus from one swarm of ants some sally out. nl            to spy another's stock or mark its rout."" nl lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter also. and the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according to the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the same kind. aristotle, in proof of this, instances the various calls of partridges, according to the situation of places: nl                  ""and various birds do from their warbling throats nl           at various times, utter quite different notes, nl           and some their hoarse songs with the seasons change."" nl but it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance. if a man will allege to me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf speak not, i answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others. nl all this i have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things, and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. we are neither above nor below the rest all that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and one fortune: nl                ""all things remain nl           bound and entangled in one fatal chain."" nl there is, indeed, some difference,—there are several orders and degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature: nl               ""all things by their own rites proceed, and draw nl          towards their ends, by nature's certain law."" nl man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity. miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the rail. he is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real pre-eminence. that which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and opinion, has neither body nor taste. and if it be so, that he only, of all the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the false and the true, 'tis an advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him,—sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. i say, then, to return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the same things that we do by our choice and industry. we ought from like effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the same ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. why should we imagine this natural constraint in them, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own. the vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the other animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour, in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very foolishly in my opinion; for i should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those i had begged and obtained from education. it is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of god and nature. nl for instance, take the fox, the people of thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before them to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters' current, and, according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire or advance,—have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid yields to impression! for to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination. we are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them. nl and if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our pleasure, 'tis still but the same advantage we have over one another. nl we have our slaves upon these terms: the climacid, were they not women in syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by which the ladies mounted their coaches? and the greatest part of free persons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being into the power of another. nl the wives and concubines of the thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband's tomb. have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion? some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in death as well as life? whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains. the form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words: ""we swear to suffer ourselves to be chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both body and soul in his service."" nl                  uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro nl            corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca. nl                 ""wound me with steel, or burn my head with fire. nl             or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire."" nl this was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand entered into it, to their destruction. when the scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines, his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of his chamber, and his cook. and upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb. the men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and dogs withal. to what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these? i do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts. diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem, him from servitude: ""they are fools,"" said he; ""'tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me."" and they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. and withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of courage. as we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to the chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks upon blackbirds and larks: nl                 ""the stork with snakes and lizards from the wood nl             and pathless wilds supports her callow brood, nl            while jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood, nl           scours the wide country for undaunted food; nl             sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away, nl            and feeds her nestlings with the generous prey."" nl we divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with our hawks and hounds. and about amphipolis, in thrace, the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. as also along the lake motis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in pieces. and as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook, there is also the like amongst other animals. aristotle says that the cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she extends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it. nl as to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man. we need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate sylla's dictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm! nl why should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody. when we see the goats of candia, when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper, immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies, and those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters too (witness the elephant of king porus whom alexander defeated), the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient;—why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason? for to allege, to their disparagement, that 'tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress. chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and, after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog: ""i have traced my master to this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;"" and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. this sally, purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and the right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from trapezuntius? nl animals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our method. we teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they have a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn. everybody, i believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word. but i observe this effect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common, in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: i have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even there where they have sufficient room to pass; i have seen them, by the trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only to keep their masters further from the ditch;—how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master's safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? and how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man? can all this be apprehended without ratiocination! nl i must not omit what plutarch says he saw of a dog at rome with the emperor vespasian, the father, at the theatre of marcellus. this dog served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages, and had therein his part. he had, amongst other things, to counterfeit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat after he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken giddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators. nl the oxen that served in the royal gardens of susa, to water them, and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which buckets were fastened (such as there are many in languedoc), being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and stand still. we are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all. nl there is more understanding required in the teaching of' others than in being taught. now, setting aside what democritus held and proved, ""that most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,"" as by the spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and nightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:—aristotle is of opinion ""that the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time and care in it;"" whence it happens that those we bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild, it is not all and every one alike—every one has learnt to do better or worse, according to their capacity. and so jealous are they one of another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place, the breath rather failing than the voice. the younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens to the master's lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher. "" have formerly seen,"" says arrian, ""an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him, rising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by the instrument; and 'twas delightful to hear this harmony."" in the spectacles of rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn. and some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters. nl but this other story of the pie, of which we have plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange. she lived in a barber's shop at rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. it happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop. after that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and melancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing. but they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops, and changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before. nl i will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same plutarch (i am sadly confounding all order, but i do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which plutarch says he saw on board a ship. this dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it. nl what is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity! 'tis said that the ravens of barbary do the same, when the water they would drink is too low. this action is somewhat akin to what juba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: ""that when, by the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out."" but this animal, in several other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should i particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, i should easily have what i usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man. the keeper of an elephant in a private house of syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance. nl one day his master would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him. nl and another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner, and filled it with ashes. these are particular effects: but that which all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the armies of the levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants, with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in a day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history); nl                   ""the sires of these huge animals were wont nl           the carthaginian hannibal to mount; nl           our leaders also did these beasts bestride, nl            and mounted thus pyrrhus his foes defied; nl            nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear nl          castles with armed cohorts to the war."" nl they must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to spoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another. they had the charge not of one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in the battle: as the spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil; and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion required; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as they did ardour and fierceness. nl we more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation. i had not else so long insisted upon these examples: for i believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. 'tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past. i have formerly seen men, brought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit, being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages and brutes! who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute, ignorant of the french tongue, ignorant of our salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example. all that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. the same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. they have several conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves, what know we what to make of them! the horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds, and most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did crassus's lamprey, and came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the lake arethusa; and i have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them. nl               ""they every one have names, and one and all nl          straightway appear at their own master's call:"" nl we may judge of that. we may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms, and, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in meditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their own motion; without instruction or precept but because we do not see any such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. as we discern something in this action which the philosopher cleanthes took notice of, because it something resembles our own. he saw, he says, ""ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so made two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation. in the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid upon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others."" this was the interpretation that cleanthes gave of this transaction, giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication, whereof 'tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. but they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it. many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that antony lost to augustus, his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the latins call remora, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself. and the emperor caligula, sailing with a great navy upon the coast of romania, his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish); and was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had without. a citizen of cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen observing, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow. the camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases, according to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or from what he has a design to seize: in the camlon 'tis a passive, but in the polypus 'tis an active, change. we have some changes of colour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the camlon. it is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow, but 'tis not in the power of our own will. now these effects that we discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as 'tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no appearances have arrived at us. nl amongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. that rule and order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by whom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. that it is so, the cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that if one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. this is a miraculous force; but 'tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it, and makes use on't; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. cranes, swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty, and put it in use. huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus, take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings back will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. by which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have. nl the manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting, moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason. for the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of the beasts' manners and way of living; for this saying (out of plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: ""keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast."" nl the chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end; nevertheless, we are ordered by lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual:— nl                 more ferarum, nl          quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur nl           concipere uxores: nl            quia sic loca sumere possunt, nl            pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis; nl and the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex:— nl                  nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt, nl            clunibus ipsa viri venerem si lta retractet, nl            atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua. nl            ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque nl           vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum. nl if it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that serve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air of our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young. and as to friendship, they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have. king lysimachus's dog, hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed, obstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was consumed, as also did the dog of one pyrrhus, for he would not stir from off his master's bed from the time he died; and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his master's body. there are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts are as capable as we. we see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour. animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice. nl desires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither natural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of men; they are all superfluous and artificial. for 'tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. the stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day. the delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites:— nl                   neque ilia nl             magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum. nl                  ""nature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims nl            the pride of titles, and the pomp of names."" nl these irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the natural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own. animals are much more regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches. and as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was rival to aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench in the city of alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her. he would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel her breasts. they tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless glaucia, in the town of asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women. we see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind. oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:— nl                   nec habetur turpe juvenc nl            ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux; nl            quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus nl             semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales. nl                 ""the heifer thinks it not a shame to take nl           her lusty sire upon her willing back: nl            the horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not nl            t' increase the herd by those they have begot; nl          and birds of all sorts do in common live, nl          and by the seed they have conceived conceive."" nl and for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher thales's mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased to practise that device. there are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though they never make any use of it at all. as to thrift, they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto. the ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. but the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting to germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout. nl as to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions, i would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not. nl                   quando leoni fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam nl            expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri? nl                  ""no lion drinks a weaker lion's gore, nl             no boar expires beneath a stronger boar."" nl yet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of bees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:— nl             spe duobus regibus incessit magno discordia motu; nl            continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello nl            gorda licet long prsciscere. nl                  ""but if contending factions arm the hive, nl            when rival kings in doubtful battle strive, nl            tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare, nl            and palpitating hearts that beat to war."" nl i never read this divine description but that, methinks, i there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. for these warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise and horror, this rattle of guns, drums, and cries, nl                fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum nl            re renidescit tellus, subterque virm vi nl             excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes nl             icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

the envy of one single man, a despite, a pleasure, a domestic jealousy, causes that ought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all this mighty bustle. shall we believe those very men who are themselves the principal authors of these mischiefs? let us then hear the greatest, the most powerful, the most victorious emperor that ever was, turning into a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles fought both by sea and land, the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men that followed his fortune, and the strength and riches of two parts of the world drained for the expense of his expeditions:— nl                  quod futuit glaphyran antonius, hanc mihi poenam nl            fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam. nl            fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me manius oret nl            podicem, faciam? non puto, si sapiam. nl           aut futue, aut pugnemus, ait nl            quid, si mihi vitii nl           charior est ips mentula? signa canant. nl                   qui? moi, que je serve fulvie! nl           sufflt-il quelle en ait envie? nl            a ce compte, on verrait se retirer von moi nl            mille pouses mal satisfaites. nl          aime-moi, me dit elle, ou combattons. mais quoi? nl            elle est bien laide! allons, sonnes trompettes. nl            'cause anthony is fired with glaphire's charms nl           fain would his fulvia tempt me to her arms. nl           if anthony be false, what then? must i nl            be slave to fulvia's lustful tyranny? nl             then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives, nl (i use my latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow me.) now this great body, with so many fronts, and so many motions, which seems to threaten heaven and earth:— nl                 quam multi lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus, nl            svus ubi orion hibemis conditur undis, nl             vel quam solo novo dens torrentur arist, nl             aut hermi campo, aut lyci flaventibus arvis;

'tis but an ant-hill disturbed and provoked:— nl          it nigrum campis agmen: nl          ""the black troop marches to the field:"" nl a contrary blast, the croaking of a flight of ravens, the stumble of a horse, the casual passage of an eagle, a dream, a voice, a sign, a morning mist, are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn him. dart but a sunbeam in his face, he is melted and vanished. blow but a little dust in his eyes, as our poet says of the bees, and all our ensigns and legions, with the great pompey himself at the head of them, are routed and crushed to pieces; for it was he, as i take it, that sertorious beat in spain with those fine arms, which also served eumenes against antigonus, and surena against crassus:— nl                  ""swarm to my bed like bees into their hives. nl           declare for love, or war, she said;

and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one. the souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings. the same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province. they are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more. in a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same. nl as to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man. our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters. king pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead man's body, and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office, commanded that the body should be buried, and took the dog along with him. one day, as he was at a general muster of his army, this dog, seeing his master's murderers, with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after perfected by form of justice. as much was done by the dog of the wise hesiod, who convicted the sons of ganictor of naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master. another dog being to guard a temple at athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke, kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place. the news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and at last found him in the city of cromyon, and the thief also, whom they brought back to athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in consideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn for the dog's daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to take care of it. plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived. nl as to gratitude (for i think we need bring this word into a little repute), this one example, which apion reports himself to have been an eye-witness of, shall suffice. nl ""one day,"" says he, ""at rome, they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious deportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud and dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one androdus, of dacia, belonging to a roman lord of consular dignity. this lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him. this being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch, who was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. at which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave to be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story: ""my master,"" said he, ""being pro-consul in africa, i was constrained, by his severity and cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and, to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province, i thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and uninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill myself. the sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat intolerable, i lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went into it soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded and bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. at his coming i was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. i then drew out a great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best i could. he, finding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. from that time forward he and i lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces, which i roasted in the sun for want of fire, and so ate it. at last, growing weary of this wild and brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision, i departed thence, and the third day after was taken by the soldiers, who brought me from africa to this city to my master, who presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts. now, by what i see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands."" this is the story that androdus told the emperor, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the lion was, by order of the people, presented to him. ""we afterwards saw,"" says apion, ""androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash, from tavern to tavern at rome, and receiving what money every body would give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him saying, 'there goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the man that cured the lion.'"" nl we often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of us:— nl                  post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, thon nl           it lacrymans, guttisque humectt grandibus ora. nl                  ""to close the pomp, thon, the steed of state. nl             is led, the fun'ral of his lord to wait. nl           stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace nl           he walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face."" nl as some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better kept than ours? as to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the cry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence? the fish scarus, when he has swallowed the angler's hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out. nl mullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut and saw it asunder. as to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life, there are several like examples amongst them. 'tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires into it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm; which plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of anticyra. there is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile. the wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach to fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger. nl he feeds of this monster's leavings, who receives him familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and when he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing it any harm at all. the shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster kind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. in the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics. as to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never stir thence till the next equinox; for which reason aristotle himself attributes to them this science. as to geometry and arithmetic, they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and make up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round with six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth, and the breadth to the length. nl as to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to alexander the great from the indies. they first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself, evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him. touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults, 'tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat, but starved himself to death. and as to clemency, 'tis said of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put in to him, he suffered a two days' hunger rather than hurt it, and the third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, and as to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation, it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame together. nl but that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the sicilian sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth? the poets indeed say that one only island, delos, which was before a floating island, was fixed for the service of latona's lying-in; but god has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed, made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst the halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the shortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger. their females never have to do with any other male but their own, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking him. if he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death. but the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials. plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done, and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky, that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. and that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within, which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so much as the water of the sea. this is a very dear description of this building, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture. now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon, and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend? nl to pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of things she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition; as rome and paris, for example, that i have in my fancy, paris that i imagine, i imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without wood; this very same privilege, i say, seems evidently to be in beasts; for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter, as if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and without body:— nl                  quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt nl           in somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque spe, nl             et quasi de palm summas contendere vires: nl                   ""you shall see maneg'd horses in their sleep nl             sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep, nl            as if with all their force they striving were nl             the victor's palm proudly away to bear:"" nl the hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur and without bones:— nl            venantumque canes in molli spe quiete nl           jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente nl          mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras, nl            ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum: nl           expergeftique sequuntur inania spe nl           cervorum simulacra, fag quasi dedita cernant; nl            donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se: nl                ""and hounds stir often in their quiet rest, nl          spending their mouths, as if upon a quest, nl          snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went nl           in a full chase upon a burning scent: nl          nay, being wak'd, imagin'd stags pursue, nl          as if they had them in their real view, nl          till, having shook themselves more broad awake, nl          they do at last discover the mistake:"" nl the watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:— nl                 consueta domi catulorum blanda propago nl             degere, spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem nl            discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant, nl            proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur. nl                  ""the fawning whelps of household curs will rise, nl           and, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes, nl           oft bark and stare at ev'ry one within, nl           as upon faces they had never seen."" nl to the beauty of the body, before i proceed any further i should know whether or no we are agreed about the description. 'tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any natural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat of the fire. but we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking:— nl          turpis romano belgicus ore color: nl          ""a german hue ill suits, a roman face."" nl the indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth, even below the roots. in peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful, which they stretch out as far as they can by art. and a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he did with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of an ear. there are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. the women are reputed more beautiful, not only in biscay, but elsewhere, for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen countries, as pliny reports. the mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders. we should paint deformity so. the italians fashion it gross and massy; the spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has it white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and majestic. just as the preference in beauty that plato attributes to the spherical figure the epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square, and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. but, be it how it will, nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest and if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others, and in greater number, that are more; a multis animalibus decore vincimur ""many animals surpass us in beauty,"" even among the terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the aerial. and this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter of, our erect stature, looking towards heaven our original, nl                   pronaque cum spectent animalia ctera terrain, nl           os homini sublime ddit, columque tueri nl           jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus, nl                 ""whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend nl           their sight, and to their earthly mother tend, nl           he set man's face aloft, that, with his eyes nl           uplifted, he might view the starry skies,"" nl is truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their sight absolutely turned towards heaven; and i find the gesture of camels and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. what animals have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite, as we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man? and what qualities of our bodily constitution, in plato and cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts? those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage, are baboons:— nl           simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis? nl           ""how like to man, in visage and in shape, nl          is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?"" nl as to the internal and vital parts, the hog. in earnest, when i consider man stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, i find that we have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. let us observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind. and really 'tis also an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade prescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of the body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves:— nl                  ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes nl             viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hsit amor. nl              ""the love that's tilting when those parts appear nl          open to view, flags in the hot career,"" nl and, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. it is not modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies so circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are painted and tricked up for the public view:— nl               nec veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ips nl           omnia summopere hos vit postscenia celant, nl          quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore: nl               ""of this our ladies are full well aware, nl          which make them, with such privacy and care, nl          behind the scene all those defects remove, nl          likely to check the flame of those they love,"" nl whereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not love, and that does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our richest ornaments and perfumes. this discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil. nl as to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. we attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent good, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion, as reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend, essential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security, innocence, and health; health, i say, the fairest and richest present that nature can make us. insomuch that philosophy, even the stoic, is so bold as to say, ""that heraclitus and pherecides, could they have trucked their wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had done well."" by which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if circe had presented ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise man, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which circe changed his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner: ""forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass."" how! the philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering? it is then no more by reason, by discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; 'tis by our beauty, our fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must quit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. well, i accept this open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts, upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy. if beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to man, miserable, wicked, mad, man. for, in short, whatever is not as we are is nothing worth; and god, to procure himself an esteem among us, must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. by which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish pride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals, and separate ourselves from their society and condition. nl but to return to what i was upon before; we have for our part inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude of things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice, jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying, disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. doubtless, we have strangely overpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject. unless we shall also think fit, as even socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, that whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons."" ut vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar, nocet sopissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino, quam tam muniice et tam large dari? as it falls out that wine often hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit, so i know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we call reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand."" of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to yarro and aristotle? did it exempt them from human inconveniences? were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter? nl did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout? or, for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less? did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common? on the contrary, having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the romans and the other amongst the greeks, and in a time when learning did most flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular excellence in their lives; nay, the greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his. have we observed that pleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands astrology and grammar than with others? nl             illiterati num minus nervi rigent? nl            ""th' illiterate ploughman is as fit nl             for venus' service as the wit:"" nl or shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last? nl                   scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis, nl            et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vit nl            longa tibi post hc fato meliore dabuntur. nl                    ""disease thy couch shall flee, nl            and sorrow and care; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see nl           long years of happiness, till now unknown."" nl i have known in my time a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser and more happy than the rectors of the university, and whom i had much rather have resembled. learning, methinks, has its place amongst the necessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most, as beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful to it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. we stand very little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition. if man was wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life. whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. old rome seems to me to have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that learned rome that ruined itself. and, though all the rest should be equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. but i will leave this discourse, that would lead me farther than i am willing to follow; and shall only say this further, 'tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man. we are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every man's own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we should at large forge ourselves duties that would, as epicurus says, enjoin us to eat one another. nl the first law that ever god gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it was a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. from obedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from selfopinion. and, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; eritis sicut dii, scientes bonum et malum. ""ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" and the sirens, in homer, to allure ulysses, and draw him within the danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. the plague of man is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and obedience; cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones, secundum elementa mundi. ""take heed, lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world."" there is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it? nl                    ad summum, sapiens uno minor est jove, dives, nl             liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum; nl             prcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est: nl                    ""in short, the wise is only less than jove, nl             rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above nl            all earthly kings; with health supremely blest, nl             excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!"" nl it seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance. 'tis as epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the use of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion. the gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in intelligence. man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his ills in essence. we have reason to magnify the power of our imagination; for all our goods are only in dream. hear this poor calamitous animal huff! ""there is nothing,"" says cicero, ""so charming as the employment of letters; of letters, i say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the immense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth, and the seas are discovered to us; 'tis they that have taught us religion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued our souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first, last, and middling; 'tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and without offence."" does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the ever-living and almighty god? but as to effects, a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than his. nl                  deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte memmi, nl           qui princeps vit rationem invenit earn, qu nl            nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem nl            fluctibus  tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris, nl           in tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit: nl                ""that god, great memmus, was a god no doubt nl          who, prince of life, first found that reason out nl          now wisdom called; and by his art, who did nl          that life in tempests tost, and darkness hid, nl          place in so great a calm, and clear a light:"" nl here are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man's understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd, notwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of democritus's book: ""i am going to speak of all things;"" and that foolish title that aristotle prefixes to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill himself,—eusebius's chronicon. nl of the mortal gods; and the judgment of chrysippus, that ""dion was as virtuous as god;"" and my seneca himself says, that ""god had given him life; but that to live well was his own;"" conformably to this other: in virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum deo, non nobis haberemus: ""we truly glory in our virtue; which would not be, if it was given us of god, and not by ourselves;"" this is also seneca's saying; ""that the wise man hath fortitude equal with god, but that his is in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals god."" there is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself equalled with god, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our creator. nl but we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. so long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his maker; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him to his shirt. let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy: posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour, by crying out against it: ""thou mayst do thy worst, i will not confess that thou art an evil."" he was as sensible of the pain as my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least, and restraining it within the laws of his sect: re succumbere non oportebat, verbis gloriantem. ""it did not become him, that spoke so big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test."" arcesilas being ill of the gout, and car-neades, who had come to see him, going away troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet and breast: ""there is nothing comes thence hither,"" said he. this has something a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be disengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor subdued by it. the other stands more obstinately to his point, but, i fear, rather verbally than really. and dionysius heracleotes, afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions. but even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently?—the philosopher pyrrho, being at sea in very great danger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. philosophy, when she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. what is the cause that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those of a horse, more easily than our own—but ignorance only? how many has mere force of imagination made sick? we often see men cause themselves to be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion.—when real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us her's; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion; this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying, this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture; there must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against yourself. compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations, to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge, and without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is really ill. whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has it in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it. nl what i say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences. thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment my ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear; and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others, and of events i see elsewhere upon the like occasion, i find of all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me. i receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare; so far am i from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living. beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. that which is told us of those of brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but i rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from all passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion. and whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest and dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous performances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. what puts the soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? of what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? as great friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; 'tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other. in the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul. who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue? plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness. great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious, ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other italian poet, to the air of the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences, that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and without soul? i was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see him at ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting both himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before his face, have been published unformed and incorrect. nl would you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a steady and secure posture? muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth. we must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led. and if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does: segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt. we are not so sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness. nl                 pungit nl            in cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus; nl           quando valere nihil quemquam movet. hoc juvat unum, nl          quod me non torquet latus, aut pes; nl          ctera quisquam vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem. nl               ""the body with a little sting is griev'd, nl          when the most perfect health is not perceiv'd, nl          this only pleases me, that spleen nor gout nl          neither offend my side nor wring my foot; nl          excepting these, scarce any one can tell, nl          or e'er observes, when he's in health and well."" nl our well-being is nothing but the not being ill. which is the reason why that sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure, has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. to be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as ennius says,— nl            nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali; nl for that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active, moving, and, i know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. the appetite that carries us headlong to women's embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever. and so of the rest. i say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition. and yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense; for crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of epicurus, if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: ""i do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired. i am very well content not to be sick; but if i am, i would know that i am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, i would feel them."" in truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure, and finally annihilate man himself: istud nihil dolere, non sine magn mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore. ""an insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul, and of stupidity of the body."" evil appertains to man of course. neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always pursued. nl 'tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune. for what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us, and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti, et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates, ponit; ""he directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;"" if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? for not only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking greek wine a month ago? it would rather only make matters worse to him:— nl           che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia. nl            ""the thinking of pleasure doubles trouble."" nl of the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to remember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we have undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power, and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek. nl            suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria. nl            ""sweet is the memory of by-gone pain."" nl how does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? for the memory represents to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it. and 'tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it. and this is false: est situm in nobis, ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus; ""it is in our power to bury, as it were, in a perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes;"" and this is true: memini etiam quo nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo. ""i do also remember what i would not; but i cannot forget what i would."" and whose counsel is this? his, qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus; ""who alone durst profess himself a wise man."" nl                 qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes nl           prstinxit stellas, exortus uti thereus sol. nl                 ""who from mankind the prize of knowledge won, nl          and put the stars out like the rising sun."" nl to empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to ignorance? nl          iners malorum remedium ignorantia est. nl          ""ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils."" nl we find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow frivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest reason will not answer the purpose, provided they administer satisfaction and comfort where they cannot cure the wound, they are content to palliate and benumb it i believe they will not deny this, that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment, they would accept it:— nl                 potare, et spargere flores nl           incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi. nl                ""give me to drink, and, crown'd with flowers, despise nl           the grave disgrace of being thought unwise."" nl there would be a great many philosophers of lycas's mind this man, being otherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his family, and not failing in any office of his duty, either towards his own or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful things, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of the finest sights and the best comedies in the world; and being cured by the physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination:— nl                 pol i me occidistis, amici, nl            non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas, nl            et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error; nl                 ""by heaven! you've killed me, friends, outright, nl           and not preserved me; since my dear delight nl          and pleasing error, by my better sense nl           unhappily return'd, is banished hence;"" nl with a madness like that of thrasylaus the son of pythodorus, who made himself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of pirus, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for his profit; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and receiving them with the greatest joy; and when his brother crito caused him to be restored to his better understanding, he infinitely regretted that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind. 'tis according to the old greek verse, that ""there is a great deal of convenience in not being over-wise."" nl and ecclesiastes, ""in much wisdom there is much sorrow;"" and ""who gets wisdom gets labour and trouble."" nl even that to which philosophy consents in general, that last remedy which she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life we are not able to endure. placet?—pare. non placet?—qucumque vis, exi. pungit dolor?—vel fodiat sane. si nudus es, da jugulum; sin tectus armis vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, rsist; ""does it please?—obey it. not please?—go where thou wilt. does grief prick thee,—nay, stab thee?—if thou art naked, present thy throat; if covered with the arms of vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it."" and this word, so used in the greek festivals, aut bibat, aut abeat, ""either drink or go,"" which sounds better upon the tongue of a gascon, who naturally changes the h into v, than on that of cicero:— nl                vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis. nl          lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti; nl          tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius quo nl            rideat et pulset lasciva decentius tas. nl                ""if to live well and right thou dost not know, nl          give way, and leave thy place to those that do. nl           thou'st eaten, drunk, and play'd to thy content, nl           'tis time to make thy parting compliment, nl           lest youth, more decent in their follies, scoff nl          the nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;"" nl what is it other than a confession of his impotency, and a sending back not only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity, insensibility, and nonentity? nl                democritum postquam matura vetustas nl           admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis; nl           sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse. nl               ""soon as, through age, democritus did find nl            a manifest decadence in his mind, nl            he thought he now surviv'd to his own wrong, nl          and went to meet his death, that stay'd too long."" nl 'tis what antisthenes said, ""that a man should either make provision of sense to understand, or of a halter to hang himself;"" and what chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet tyrtus:— nl          ""or to arrive at virtue or at death;"" nl and crates said, ""that love would be cured by hunger, if not by time; and whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope."" that sextius, of whom both seneca and plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having applied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of philosophy, resolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the progress of his studies too tedious and slow. he ran to find death, since he could not overtake knowledge. these are the words of the law upon the subject: ""if peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no remedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff; for 'tis the fear of dying, and not the love of life, that ties the fool to his body."" nl as life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as i was saying before: ""the simple and ignorant,"" says st. paul, ""raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss."" i am neither swayed by valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by licinius, both roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. such as return from the new world discovered by the spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:— nl                    di cittatorie piene, e di libelli, nl            d'esamine, e di carte di procure, nl            hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli nl           di chioge, di consigli, et di letture: nl           per cui le faculta de* poverelli nl            non sono mai nelle citt sicure; nl             hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati, nl             notai, procuratori, ed avvocati. nl                     ""their bags were full of writs, and of citations, nl             of process, and of actions and arrests, nl             of bills, of answers, and of replications, nl             in courts of delegates, and of requests, nl             to grieve the simple sort with great vexations; nl             they had resorting to them as their guests, nl             attending on their circuit, and their journeys, nl            scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys."" nl it was what a roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as i interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself. nl christians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. pride was his ruin and corruption. 'tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father:  ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us? nl after that socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. he knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. at last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his god considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. the sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: ""dust and ashes,"" says it to such, ""what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?"" and, in another place, ""god has made man like unto a shadow,"" of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! man is a thing of nothing. nl our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. to meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. if it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. melius scitur deus nesdendo: ""god is better known by not knowing him,"" says st. austin: and tacitus, sanctius est ac reverentius de actis deorum credere, quam scire; ""it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of god than to know them;"" and plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into god, the world, and the first causes of things: atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas: ""to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,"" says cicero. we talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. we say that god fears, that god is angry, that god loves, nl            immortalia mortali sermone notantes: nl           ""giving to things immortal mortal names."" nl these are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in god, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. it only belongs to god to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth. how can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? how can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? how justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in god? how temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the divinity? fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. for which reason aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia? ""he can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty."" nl the participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: god has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by__ the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, ""i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world? for after that, in the wisdom of god, the world knew not god, it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."" nl finally, should i examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so many ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; i believe he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness. we have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before. the same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. so men, having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition. 'tis what velleius reproaches cotta withal and cicero, ""that they had learned of philo, that they had learned nothing."" pherecydes, one of the seven sages, writing to thales upon his death-bed; ""i have,"" said he, ""given order to my people, after my interment, to carry my writings to thee. if they please thee and the other sages, publish; if not, suppress them. they contain no certainty with which i myself am satisfied. neither do i pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it. i rather open than discover things."" the wisest man that ever was, being asked what he knew, made answer, ""he knew this, that he knew nothing."" by which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even what we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our ignorance. we know things in dreams, says plato, and are ignorant of them in truth. ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia curricula vito. ""almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses are too limited, men's minds too weak, and the course of life too short."" and of cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, valerius says, ""that he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy."" dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans plerumque, et mihi diffidens. ""something i must say, but so as to affirm nothing; i inquire into all things, but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself."" nl i should have too fair a game should i consider man in his common way of living and in gross; yet i might do it by his own rule, who judges truth not by weight, but by the number of votes. let us set the people aside, nl               qui vigilans stertit,.... nl            mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti; nl                 ""half of his life by lazy sleep's possess'd, nl           and when awake his soul but nods at best;"" nl who neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie idle; i will take man in his highest ground. let us consider him in that little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who, having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have moreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. they have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without the world; 'tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain. they have regulated the world with policies and laws. they have instructed it with arts and sciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. i shall make account of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience. let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. the errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own. nl whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet upon the search. all philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her design is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. the peripatetics, epicureans, stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. these established the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain knowledge. clitomachus, carneades, and the academics, have despaired in their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings. the result of these is weakness and human ignorance. this sect has had the most and the most noble followers. pyrrho, and other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from homer, the seven sages, and from archilochus and euripides, and to whose number these are added, zeno, democritus, and xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth. these conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it; for this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the difficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they doubt whether man is capable:— nl                  nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit, nl            an sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur. nl                ""he that says nothing can be known, o'erthrows nl            his own opinion, for he nothing knows, nl           so knows not that."" nl the ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that the profession of the pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and consentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another, so light as it is. zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: ""an open and expanded hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little bending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge."" now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without application or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a peaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience, obstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after a very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed, and love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment, which is their end. they only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief. if you take their arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; 'tis all one to them, they have no choice. if you maintain that snow is black, they will argue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. if you hold, of certain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they will argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt. and by this extremity of doubt, which jostles itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and ignorance. ""why shall not they be allowed to doubt,"" say they, ""as well as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? can any thing be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous?"" and where others are carried away, either by the custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by accident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay, and for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such an opinion, to the sect whether stoic or epicurean, with which they are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot forsake: ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn, tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt; ""every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest;"" why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? hoc liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas: ""in this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater power of judging."" is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others? is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle one's self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced? is it not much better to suspend one's persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: ""what shall i choose?"" ""what you please, provided you will choose."" a very foolish answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of. nl take the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. is it not better to keep out of this hurly-burly? you are permitted to embrace aristotle's opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life, and to give the lie to plato thereupon, and shall they be interdicted to doubt him? if it be lawful for pantius to maintain his opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the stoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he is a professor and a member? if it be a child that judges, he knows not what it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. they have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of the care of defence. if you strike them, they care not, provided they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. if they overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short, they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that nothing is known, 'tis well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis also well: ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur: ""that when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing, the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended."" and they make account to find out, with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why 'tis true; that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe, than what they do. their way of speaking is: ""i assert nothing; it is no more so than so, or than neither one nor t'other; i understand it not. appearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, pro or con, is the same. nothing seems true, that may not seem false."" their sacramental word is that is to say, ""i hold, i stir not."" this is the burden of their song, and others of like stuff. the effect of which is a pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. they make use of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine. whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever, conceives a true idea of pyrrhonism. i express this fancy as well as i can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely. nl as to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the common fashion. they yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution of laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; non enim nos deus ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit. ""for god would not have us know, but only use those things."" they suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. for which reason i cannot consent to what is said of pyrrho, by those who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and unsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. this is to enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or a stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning, enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason. the fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and renounced. yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if he means to live. and if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances, provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. he has a body, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. and although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience. how many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge; that decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so! there are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. we are much more prudent, in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without inquiry. a soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose. men that judge and control their judges, do never duly submit to them. nl how much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human causes! there is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty, confessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from above, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more room to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a sworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. 'tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of god as he shall please to write upon it. the more we resign and commit ourselves to god, and the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. ""take in good part,"" says ecclesiastes, ""the things that present themselves to thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy knowledge."" dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van sunt: ""the lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity."" nl thus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open profession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the dogmatists, which is the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth: quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt: ""which the learned rather feign than know."" timus, being to instruct socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men, proposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient, if his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of his followers has thus imitated: ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut pythius apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero; sed, ut homunculus, probabilia conjectur sequens: ""i will, as well as i am able, explain; affirming, yet not as the pythian oracle, that what i say is fixed and certain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture."" and this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death; he has elsewhere translated from the very words of plato: si forte, de deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis? ""if perchance, when we discourse of the nature of god, and the world's original, we cannot do it as we desire, it will be no great wonder. for it is just you should remember that both i who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more."" aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men's opinions and beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others; which made epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings. this is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. in earnest, we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice; it is, in effect, a pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. hear cicero's protestation, who expounds to us another's fancy by his own: qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a socrate, repetita ab arcesila, conjirmata a gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota. ""they who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. this practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely concluding nothing, begun by socrates, repeated by arcesilaus, and confirmed by cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. we are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent."" why hath not aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick? clitomachus affirmed ""that he could never discover by carneades's writings what opinion he was of."" this was it that made epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured heraclitus the epithet of  difficulty is a coin the learned make use of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay. nl                  claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes... nl          omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque nl           inversis qu sub verbis latitantia cemunt. nl                 ""bombast and riddle best do puppies please, nl          for fools admire and love such things as these; nl          and a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase, nl           up to the height doth their wise wonder raise."" nl cicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life, and more profitable and proper studies. the cyrenaick philosophers, in like manner, despised physics and logic. zeno, in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use. chrysippus said ""that what plato and aristotle had writ, concerning logic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;"" and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. plutarch says the same of metaphysics. and epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy excepted, of all the sciences; and socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life. whatever any one required to be instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary: parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt. ""that learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue."" most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage. nl as to the rest, some have looked upon plato as a dogmatist, others as a doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other. socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself. homer, their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose. 'tis said that ten several sects sprung from plato; yet, in my opinion, never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not. nl socrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and that by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty of bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that could; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their birth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others. nl it is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the ancients have observed in the writings of anaxagoras, democritus, parmenides, xenophanes, and others. they have a way of writing, doubtful in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods. is not the same thing seen in seneca and plutarch? how many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them! so many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies. it is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously and with greater profit. let us take example from ourselves: judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking; and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people, the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion, which with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit and the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim—""in a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief;"" for, as euripides says,— nl          ""god's various works perplex the thoughts of men."" nl like that which empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and compelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: ""no, no, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;"" according to the divine saying: cogitationes mortalium timid, et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice. ""for the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain."" it is not to be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt after, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures, the stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge. nl democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that ""he need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey."" he was vexed at this discovery, and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon: ""go thy way,"" said he, ""thou hast done me an injury; but, for all that, i will seek out the cause as if it were natural;"" and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect. this story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking. satius est supervacua discere, quam nihil. ""'tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all."" as in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. thus they say: ""the consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing them with those that are celestial and high. the mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it."" this is what they profess. the vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge. ""eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to comprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should thereby be immediately burned."" he would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have acquired. nl i cannot easily persuade myself that epicurus, plato, and pytagoras, have given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. they were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain. but in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though false, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them. unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti vi. ""these things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of knowledge."" nl one of the ancients, who was reproached, ""that he professed philosophy, of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,"" made answer, ""that this was truly to philosophize."" nl they wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity. some things they wrote for the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country. nl plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. when he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his laws, he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. he says very roundly, in his republic, ""that it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them."" it is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their reputation. 'tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life. the boldest sects, as the epicurean, pyrrhonian, and the new academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account. nl there are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some to the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any certain truth, but merely for exercise. non tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse. ""they seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter."" and if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men? as, for example, what can be more vain than to imagine, to guess at god, by our analogies and conjectures? to direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws? and to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity, with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries? nl of all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged god as an incomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all goodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies soever— nl                jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, demque, nl             progenitor, genitrixque. nl                 ""jove, the almighty, author of all things, nl          the father, mother, of both gods and kings."" nl this zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye. all governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. pagan histories acknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; god, through his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. not only deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that st. paul found in repute at athens, that which they had dedicated ""to the unknown god"" seemed to him the most to be excused. nl pythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection, every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity. but if numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use; the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model. the divine majesty has thus, in some sort, suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage. his supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for 'tis man that believes and prays. i shall omit the other arguments upon this subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our saviour's passion, that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the senses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect. nl of those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that universal blindness, i should, i fancy, most incline to those who adored the sun:— nl                la lumire commune, nl           l'oil du monde; et si dieu au chef porte des yeux, nl            les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux, nl             qui donnent vie  touts, nous maintiennent et gardent, nl            et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent: nl           ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons, nl          selon qu'il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons; nl          qui remplit l'univers de ses vertus cognues; nl           qui d'un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues; nl            l'esprit, l'ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant, nl            en la course d'un jour tout le ciel tournoyant; nl            plein d'immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme; nl             lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme: nl           en repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans sjour; nl          fils aisn de nature, et le pre du jour: nl                 ""the common light that equal shines on all, nl            diffused around the whole terrestrial ball; nl            and, if the almighty ruler of the skies nl           has eyes, the sunbeams are his radiant eyes, nl            that life and safety give to young and old, nl             and all men's actions upon earth behold. nl            this great, this beautiful, the glorious sun, nl            who makes their course the varied seasons run; nl          that with his virtues fills the universe, nl            and with one glance can sullen clouds disperse; nl           earth's life and soul, that, flaming in his sphere, nl           surrounds the heavens in one day's career; nl          immensely great, moving yet firm and round, nl          who the whole world below has made his bound; nl          at rest, without rest, idle without stay, nl          nature's first son, and father of the day:"" nl forasmuch as, beside this grandeur and beauty of his, 'tis the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us; and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it. nl thales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed god to be a spirit that made all things of water; anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an infinite number of worlds; anaximines, that the air was god, that he was procreate and immense, always moving. anaxagoras the first, was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit. alcmon gave divinity to the sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. pythagoras made god a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by the ardour of light. empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which all things are composed, to be gods; protagoras had nothing to say, whether they were or were not, or what they were; democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods; another while, the nature that darts out those images; and then, our science and intelligence. plato divides his belief into several opinions; he says, in his timus, that the father of the world cannot be named; in his laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and elsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the stars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic. nl xenophon reports a like perplexity in socrates's doctrine; one while that men are not to inquire into the form of god, and presently makes him maintain that the sun is god, and the soul god; that there is but one god, and then that there are many. speusippus, the nephew of plato, makes god a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul. aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one while he gives the world another master, and another while makes god the heat of heaven. zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets; the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. heraclides ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion, and finally deprives god of sense, and makes him shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven and earth. theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. strato says that 'tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation, and diminution, without form and sentiment zeno says 'tis the law of nature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal; and takes away the accustomed gods, jupiter, juno, and vesta. diogenes apolloniates, that 'tis air. zenophanes makes god round, seeing and hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature. aristo thinks the form of god to be incomprehensible, deprives him of sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else; cleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world, another the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and environing all. perseus, zeno's disciple, was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added any notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things themselves. chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes, the men also that have been deified. diagoras and theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all. epicurus makes the gods shining, transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such members as we have; which members are to them of no use:— nl               ego deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum; nl          sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus. nl               ""i ever thought that gods above there were, nl          but do not think they care what men do here."" nl trust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads! the perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me, in comparing them. and all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of god seems to me a choice of very little privilege. the policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our reason. the things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding. i would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties. but to have made gods of our own condition, of whom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to them desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love, jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding; nl               qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant, nl           inque dem numro qu sint indigna videri; nl               ""from divine natures these so distant are, nl          they are unworthy of that character."" nl formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt;

for they are represented to us with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger of the gods;"" as having attributed divinity not only to faith, virtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to voluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:— nl               quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores? nl          o curv in terris anim et colestium inanes! nl                ""o earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led, nl          to every spark of heav'nly influence dead! nl          think ye that what man values will inspire nl          in minds celestial the same base desire?"" nl the egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of hanging, that any one should say that their gods, serapis and isis, had formerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth, signified, says varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them. seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to god, he had done better, says cicero, to have attracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither below, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take it right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like vanity of opinion. nl when philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and power, i cannot believe they speak as they think. when plato describes pluto's orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies, and accommodates them to the feeling we have in this life:— nl                 secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum nl          sylva tegit; cur non ips in morte relinquunt; nl               ""in secret vales and myrtle groves they lie, nl          nor do cares leave them even when they die."" nl when mahomet promises his followers a paradise hung with tapestry, gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with wenches of excelling beauty, rare wines, and delicate dishes; it is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their promises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes and opinions suitable to our mortal appetites. and yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures. can we believe that plato, he who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the divinity as thence to derive the name of the divine plato, ever thought that the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient, to participate of beatitude or eternal pains? we should then tell him from human reason: ""if the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that i have enjoyed here below, this has nothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition, it cannot be of any value. all contentment of mortals is mortal. even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends, if that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences. we cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them; to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable, inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience."" ""eye hath not seen,"" saith st. paul, ""nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things that god hath prepared for them that love him."" and if, to render us capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, plato, sayest, by thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that by physical doctrine it be no more us;— nl                 hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille nl           tractus ab monio non erat hector eqao; nl                he hector was whilst he could fight, but when nl           dragg'd by achilles' steeds, no hector then; nl it must be something else that must receive these recompenses:— nl               quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo; nl          trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant. nl              ""things changed dissolved are, and therefore die; nl          their parts are mix'd, and from their order fly."" nl for in pythagoras's metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of csar is enclosed, does espouse csar's passions, or that the lion is he? for if it was still csar, they would be in the right who, controverting this opinion with plato, reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like absurdities. and can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are not other than their predecessors? from the ashes of a phoenix, a worm, they say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? we see our silk-worms, as it were, die and wither; and from this withered body a butterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this was still the first! that which once has ceased to be is no more:— nl               nec, si materiam nostram collegerit tas nl          post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est, nl          atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit, nl          pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum, nl          interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra. nl               ""neither tho' time should gather and restore nl          our matter to the form it was before, nl          and give again new light to see withal, nl          would that new figure us concern at all; nl          or we again ever the same be seen, nl          our being having interrupted been."" nl and, plato, when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the recompense of another life, thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as little appearance of truth:— nl               scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam nl           dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto; nl               ""no more than eyes once from their optics torn, nl          can ever after any thing discern;"" nl for, by this account, it would no more be man, nor consequently us, who would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two principal essential parts, the separation of which is the death and ruin of our being:— nl               inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque nl          deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes; nl               ""when once that pause of life is come between, nl            'tis just the same as we had never been;"" nl we cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members, and that the earth consumes them:— nl               et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque nl          corporis atque anim consistimus uniter apti. nl              ""what's that to us? for we are only we, nl          while soul and body in one frame agree."" nl moreover, upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice of or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it was themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? and why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their will, they might prevent him from falling? might not epicurus, with great colour of human reason, object this to plato, did he not often save himself with this sentence: ""that it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?"" she does nothing but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things. who does more evidently perceive this than we? for although we have given her certain and infallible principles; and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased god to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this vast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint, and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths. nl man cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity. ""tis a greater presumption,"" says plutarch, ""in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to."" antiquity, i believe, thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties, and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities; offering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances, mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it, and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to our vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as tiberius sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in sardinia for a sacrifice to vulcan; and paulus milius, those of macedonia, to mars and minerva; and alexander, arriving at the indian ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into the sea, in honour of thetes; and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and i believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:— nl                sulmone creatos nl          quatuor hc juvenes, totidem quos educat ufens, nl          viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris. nl               ""four sons of sulmo, four whom ufens bred, nl           he took in flight, and living victims led, nl          to please the ghost of pallas, and expire nl          in sacrifice before his fun'ral pyre."" nl the get hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god zamolxis. every five years they dispatch some one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of. this envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon which the rest throw his body with all their force. if he happen to be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, 'tis held a certain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead. amestris, the mother of xerxes, being grown old, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of persia, to be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify some infernal deity. and even to this day the idols of themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of innocent blood:— nl               tantum religio potuit suadere maloram. nl          ""such impious use was of religion made, nl          so many demon acts it could persuade."" nl the carthaginians immolated their own children to saturn; and those who had none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance. nl it was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions; like the lacedemonians, who regaled their diana with the tormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake, very often to death. it was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that poor iphigenia, at the port of aulis, should by her death and immolation acquit, towards god, the whole army of the greeks from all the crimes they had committed; nl                et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso, nl          hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis; nl               ""that the chaste virgin in her nuptial band nl          should die by an unnat'ral father's hand;"" nl and that the two noble and generous souls of the two decii, the father and the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy: quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo romano non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent? ""how great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of rome unless such men perished!"" to which may be added, that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers. the divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us, both for its justice and for our own penalty. and therefore it was a ridiculous humour of polycrates, tyrant of samos, who, to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly, ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found in the belly of a fish. and then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the corybantes, the menades, and, in our times, of the mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their prophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast, eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat? tantus est perturbto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt. ""so great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve."" the use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us, but also to the service of god and other men; 'tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that are stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason: ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios habere merentur? in regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam; sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit. ""where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate? some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes: but no man at his master's command has put his own hand to unman himself."" so did they fill their religion with several ill effects:— nl          spius olim religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta. nl          ""in elder times religion did commit most fearful crimes."" nl now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto the divine nature, which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection. nl how can that infinite beauty, power, and goodness, admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness? infirmum dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus. ""for the foolishness of god is wiser than men, and the weakness of god is stronger than men."" stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, ""whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?""—""you are indiscreet,"" answered he; ""let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of such things."" nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power besieged by our reasons (i call our ravings and dreams reason, with the dispensation of philosophy, which says, ""that the wicked man, and even the fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason""), we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings,—him who has made both us and our knowledge. because that nothing is made of nothing, god therefore could not make the world without matter. what! has god put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power? is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge? put the case, o man! that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work? thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much; whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. this part is nothing in comparison of the whole:— nl                 omnia cum colo, terrque, manque, nl            nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem. nl                ""the earth, the sea, and skies, from pole to pole, nl            are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole."" nl 'tis a municipal law that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is universal tie thyself to that to which thou art subject, but not him; he is not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. if he has in some sort communicated himself unto thee, 'tis not to debase himself unto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his power; the human body cannot fly to the clouds; rules are for thee. the sun runs every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot preserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. 'tis for thee that he has made these rules; 'tis thee that they concern; he has manifested to christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him. and, in truth, why, almighty as he is, should he have limited his power within any certain bounds? in favour of whom should he have renounced his privilege? thy reason has in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that there is a plurality of worlds:— nl                  terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant, nl            non esse unica, sed numro magis innumerali. nl                   ""that earth, sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are, nl            not single, but innumerable were."" nl the most eminent minds of elder times believed it; and some of this age of ours, compelled by the appearances of human reason, do the same; forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and one, nl           cum in summ res nulla sit una, nl            unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat; nl                 ""since nothing's single in this mighty place, nl            that can alone beget, alone increase;"" nl and that all the kinds are multiplied in some number; by which it seems not to be likely that god should have made this work only without a companion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally drained in this individual. nl                quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est nl            esse alios alibi congressus materiali; nl           qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet ther. nl                ""wherefore 'tis necessary to confess nl           that there must elsewhere be the like congress nl           of the like matter, which the airy space nl           holds fast within its infinite embrace."" nl especially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so credible that plato affirms it, and that many of our people do either confirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient opinion that the heavens, the stars, and other members of the world, are creatures composed of body and soul, mortal in respect of their composition, but immortal by the determination of the creator. now if there be many worlds, as democritus, epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed, what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest? they may peradventure have another form and another polity. epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. we see in this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers; 'tis all there another thing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of bacchus or ceres. if pliny and herodotus are to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal natures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites; where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead, and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the lower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years old, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men have no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject seed of a black colour. what shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? and if it be true, as plutarch says, that in some place of the indies there are men without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours, how many of our descriptions are false? he is no longer risible, nor, perhaps, capable of reason and society. the disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and of no use. nl moreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? and yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto god himself! how many things do we call miraculous, and contrary to nature? this is done by every nation and by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. how many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? for, for us to go ""according to nature,"" is no more but to go ""according to our understanding,"" as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and irregular. now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be assured that snow is white, and anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge or ignorance, which metrodorus of chios denied that man was able to determine; or whether we live, as euripides doubts whether the life we live is life, or whether that we call death be not life,  and not without some appearance. for why do we derive the title of being from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and also a good part of the moment itself. others swear there is no motion at all, as followers of melissus, and that nothing stirs. for if there be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him, nor motion from one place to another, as plato proves: ""that there is neither generation nor corruption in nature."" protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things; nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is more than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty; parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general; that there is but one thing; zeno, that one same is not, and that there is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. according to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false or vain. nl this way of speaking in a christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent. ""god cannot die; god cannot contradict himself; god cannot do this or that."" i do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of men's mouths; and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed. nl our speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes. how many quarrels, and of how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable, hoc,* created in the world? let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself nl             * montaigne here refers to the controversies between nl               the catholics and protestants about transubstantiation. nl presents us withal; if you say, ""it is fine weather,"" and that you say true, it is then fine weather. is not this a very certain form of speaking? and yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow the example: if you say, ""i lie,"" if you say true, you do lie. the art, the reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. the pyrrhonian philosophers, i see, cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for they would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch that when they say ""i doubt,"" they are presently taken by the throat, to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt. by which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison, without which their humour would be inexplicable: when they pronounce, ""i know not,"" or, ""i doubt,"" they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself off with them. this fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation: ""what do i know?"" as i bear it with the emblem of a balance. nl see what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the present disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too hard, they will roundly tell you, ""that it is not in the power of god to make it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in several places at once."" and see, too, what advantage the old scoffer made of this. ""at least,"" says he, ""it is no little consolation to man to see that god cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he cannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had them; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion."" and that the comparison of man to god may yet be made out by jocose examples: ""he cannot order it so,"" says he, ""that twice ten shall not be twenty."" this is what he says, and what a christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips. whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language, to reduce god to their own measure:— nl                 cras vel atr nube polum, pater, occupato, nl           vel sole puro; non tamen irritum nl           quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque nl            diffinget infectumque reddet nl             quod fugiens semel hora vexit. nl                ""to-morrow, let it shine or rain, nl            yet cannot this the past make vain: nl            nor uncreate and render void nl            that which was yesterday enjoyed."" nl when we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but one instant with god; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend it not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must make the divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu. ""'tis wonderful to what the wickedness of man's heart will proceed, if elevated with the least success."" how magisterially and insolently does epicurus reprove the stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to god, and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it! how temerariously have they bound god to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name of a christian shall ever do again)! and thales, plato, and pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity. this arrogance of attempting to discover god with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what happens to us every day, of attributing to god important events, by a particular assignment. because they weigh with us, they conclude that they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course: magna dii curant, parva negligunt: ""the gods are concerned at great matters, but slight the small."" listen to him; he will clear this to you by his reason: nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant: ""neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns."" as if to that king of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea. the hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him. deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit in parvis: ""god is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no less in the least"" our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us. because our employments are a burden to us, strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their priests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world, discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: quod beatum terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri: ""what is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another."" nature will that in like things there should be a like relation. the infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a like number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit. as the souls of the gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of men, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some ecstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the body, they could not see. ""men,"" says st. paul, ""professing themselves to be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man."" do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications. after the great and stately pomp of the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the same time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the soul went into paradise. we have a thousand medals, and particularly of the worthy faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. 'tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions, nl           quod finxere, timent, nl           ""they fear their own inventions,"" nl like children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow, that they themselves have smeared and smutted. quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur: nl ""as if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by his own imagination."" 'tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour him that we have made. augustus had more temples than jupiter, served with as much religion and belief of miracles. the thracians, in return of the benefits they had received from agesilaus, came to bring him word that they had canonized him: ""has your nation,"" said he to them, ""the power to make gods of whom they please? pray first deify some one amongst yourselves, and when i shall see what advantage he has by it, i will thank you for your offer."" man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. hear trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency: ""of all the wonderful things, it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it."" and take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:— nl                nosse cui divos et coli munina soli, nl           aut soli nescire, datum. nl                ""to whom to know the deities of heaven, nl           or know he knows them not, alone 'tis given."" nl ""if there is a god, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature, he has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. if he be without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action; and if he has a body, it is perishable."" is not here a triumph? we are incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work. it were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe. there must then be something that is better, and that must be god. when you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for rats. and this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial palace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor, who is much greater than we? is not the most supreme always the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. the world produces us, the world then has soul and reason. every part of us is less than we. we are part of the world, the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'tis a fine thing to have a great government; the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature. the stars do us no harm; they are then full of goodness. we have need of nourishment; then so have the gods also, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. worldly goods are not goods to god; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; 'tis therefore folly to fear god. god is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more. the divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the first is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we are companions. we have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. in conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. what a pattern, and what a model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:— nl            non, si tu ruperis, inquit. nl           ""not if thou burst,"" said he. nl profecto non deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant? ""certainly they do not imagine god, whom they cannot imagine; but they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but themselves, not to him, but to themselves."" in natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes. what's this to the purpose? his condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote, and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions. 'tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place; our ways lie too low. we are no nearer heaven on the top of mount cenis than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe. they debase god even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times, and so many generations. paulina, the wife of satuminus, a matron of great reputation at rome, thinking she lay with the god serapis, found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the priests of his temple. varro, the most subtle and most learned of all the latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of hercules's temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the other for hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his own. the sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. her name was laurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly reward; which proved to be taruncius, a rich young man, who took her home to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. she, in her turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the people of rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed to her. as if it had not been sufficient that plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had neptune for the common father of his race, it was certainly believed at athens, that aristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair perictione, could not, and was warned by the god apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. these were the father and mother of plato. how many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! and how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! in the mahometan religion there are merlins enough found by the belief of the people; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much in their language. nl we are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions: of all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore god must be of that form. no one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without reason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; god is therefore clothed in a human figure. ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de deo cogitet, forma occurrat hu-mana. ""it is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so prepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of god, a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination."" therefore it was that xenophanes pleasantly said, ""that if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as 'tis likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and glorify themselves in it, as we do. for why may not a goose say thus; ""all the parts of the universe i have an interest in; the earth serves me to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; i have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me; i am the darling of nature! is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me? 'tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the same by his fellow-men, and so do i the worms that kill and devour him."" as much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the account of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high and beautiful region. tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa natura. ""so flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself."" nl now by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us; ''tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims. look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man. she does not allow them any other consultation or occupation. see them here against us in war:— nl                domitosque hercule manu nl           telluris juvenes, unde periculum nl           fulgens contre mu it domus nl           saturai veteris. nl           ""the brawny sons of earth, subdu'd by hand nl           of hercules on the phlegran strand, nl           where the rude shock did such an uproar make, nl           as made old saturn's sparkling palace shake."" nl and here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a return for our having so often shared in theirs:— nl           neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti nl           fundamenta quatit, totamque  sedibus urbem nl           emit: hie juno scas svissima portas prima tenet. nl                ""amidst that smother neptune holds his place, nl           below the walls' foundation drives his mace, nl           and heaves the city from its solid base. nl           see where in arms the cruel juno stands, nl            full in the scan gate."" nl the caunians, jealous of the authority of their own proper gods, armed themselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords, by that means to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory. their powers are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that the phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: adeo minimis etiam rebus prava religio inserit deos? ""at such a rate does false religion create gods for the most contemptible uses."" this one makes grapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that over merchandise; for every sort of artisan a god; this has his province and reputation in the east; that his in the west:— nl                ""here lay her armour, here her chariot stood."" nl                o sancte apollo, qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines! nl                  ""o sacred phoebus, who with glorious ray, nl            from the earth's centre, dost thy light display."" nl           pallada cecropid, minola creta dianam, nl            vulcanum tellus hypsipylea colit, nl           junonem sparte, pelopeladesque mycen; nl           pinigerum fauni mnalis ora caput; nl           mars latio venerandus. nl                ""th' athenians pallas, cynthia crete adore, nl            vulcan is worshipped on the lemnian shore. nl            proud juno's altars are by spartans fed, nl           th' arcadians worship faunus, and 'tis said nl           to mars, by italy, is homage paid."" nl to our necessity; this cures horses, that men, nl           hic illius arma, hic currus fuit. nl this has only one town or family in his possession; that lives alone; that in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:— nl                junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo. nl                 ""and temples to the nephew joined are, nl           to those were reared to the great-grandfather."" nl in here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and thirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce one ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a door—that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold. four to a child—protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and sucking. some certain, some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are not yet entered paradise:— nl                quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore, nl           quas dedimus cert terras habitare sinanras: nl                ""whom, since we yet not worthy think of heaven, nl           we suffer to possess the earth we've given."" nl there are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. some of a mean betwixt the divine and human nature; mediators betwixt god and us, adorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite in titles and offices; some good; others ill; some old and decrepit, and some that are mortal. for chrysippus was of opinion that in the last conflagration of the world all the gods were to die but jupiter. man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt god and him; is he not his countryman? nl           jovis incunabula creten. nl           ""crete, the cradle of jupiter."" nl and this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject, scvola, a high priest, and varro, a great theologian in their times, make us: ""that it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true, and believe many things that are false."" quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur. ""seeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be made free, 'tis fit he should be deceived."" human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap miserable phton took for attempting to guide his father's horses with a mortal hand. the mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. if you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will she return, if not that it is iron, or, with anaxagoras, stone, or some other matter that she makes use of? if a man inquire of zeno what nature is? ""a fire,"" says he, ""an artisan, proper for generation, and regularly proceeding."" archimedes, master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty; ""the sun,"" says he, ""is a god of red-hot iron."" was not this a fine imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations? yet not so inevitable and useful but that socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold; and that polynus, who had been a great and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of epicurus. socrates in xenophon, concerning this affair, says of anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, ""that he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:"" when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse, that it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that we are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and plants. 'tis socrates's opinion, and mine too, that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all. plato having occasion, in his timous, to speak of the demons, ""this undertaking,"" says he, ""exceeds my ability."" we are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them; 'tis against all reason to refuse a man's faith to the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things. nl let us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things. is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain, another body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:— nl                 temo aureus, aurea summ nl             curvatura rot, radiorum argenteus ordo. nl                 ""gold was the axle, and the beam was gold; nl            the wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll'd."" nl you would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters, that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity, according to plato:— nl                mundus domus est maxima rerum, nl           quam quinque altiton fragmine zon nl           cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis nl           stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo there, lun nl           bigas acceptat. nl                ""the world's a mansion that doth all things hold, nl           which thundering zones, in number five, enfold, nl           through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs, nl           and that with sparkling constellations, shines, nl           in heaven's arch marks the diurnal course nl           for the sun's chariot and his fiery horse."" nl these are all dreams and fanatic follies. why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? good god, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science! i am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is, and i shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance. nl have i not read in plato this divine saying, that ""nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy!"" as if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures: latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit. ""all those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth."" and certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. plato is but a poet unripped. timon calls him, insultingly, ""a monstrous forger of miracles."" all superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say, legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice); she gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she herself informs us were invented; for these epicycles, eccentrics, and concentrics, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject; as also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really is, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest invention. plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts, says, ""i should know that what i have said is truth, had i the confirmation of an oracle; but this i will affirm, that what i have said is the most likely to be true of any thing i could say."" nl 'tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels; let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our contexture. nl there is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found out in this poor little human body. in earnest, they have good reason, upon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it. to assist the motions they see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in how many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it? in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to be perceived? and how many offices and vocations have they assigned him? they make it an imaginary public thing. 'tis a subject that they hold and handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place, displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and yet they possess it not they cannot, not in reality only, but even in dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches. and it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven, earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and despise them if they fail in it. nl i am very well pleased with the milesian girl, who observing the philosopher thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and to have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet. doubtless she advised him well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as democritus says, by the mouth of cicero,— nl              quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas. nl                   ""no man regards what is under his feet; nl              they are always prying towards heaven."" nl but our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the stars. as socrates says, in plato, ""that whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. for every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether beasts or men."" nl those people, who find sebond's arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the world, that know all,— nl                 qu mare compescant caus; quid temperet annum; nl            stell sponte su, jussve, vagentur et errent; nl           quid premat obscurum lun, quid profrt orbem; nl           quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors; nl                 ""what governs ocean's tides, nl           and through the various year the seasons guides; nl           whether the stars by their own proper force, nl            or foreign power, pursue their wand'ring course; nl           why shadows darken the pale queen of night; nl            whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;— nl           what nature's jarring sympathy can mean;"" nl have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being? we see very well that the finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another paleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon the brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members; at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies something lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet man knew: omnia incerta ratione, et in natur majestate abdita. ""all uncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,"" says pliny. and st augustin, modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus.... omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse homo est, ""the manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man."" and yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if it were religion and law. 'tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is admitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to be accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies. the reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root, where the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches; they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether galen has said any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. in truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and arts. the god of scholastic knowledge is aristotle; 'tis irreligion to question any of his decrees, as it was those of lucurgus at sparta; his doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as another. i do not know why i should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of plato, or the atoms of epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of leucippus and democritus, or the water of thales, or the infinity of nature of anaximander, or the air of diogenes, or the numbers and symmetry of pythagoras, or the infinity of parmenides, or the one of musus, or the water and fire of apollodorus, or the similar parts of anaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of empedocles, or the fire of heraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as i should the opinion of aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces—matter, form, and privation. and what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things? privation is a negative; of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are? and yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire. nl it is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please; for, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. by this way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture; for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our god; he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds, if he so please. in this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of pythagoras, ""that every expert person ought to be believed in his own art"" for current pay. the logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check. if you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this sentence in their mouths, ""that there is no disputing with persons who deny principles."" now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the end, is nothing but dream and vapour. to those that contend upon presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is. for every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make the difference. wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. the persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less philosophers, than the philodoxes of plato; we must inquire whether fire be hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge? nl and as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid to put ice into his bosom;—they are pitiful things, unworthy of the profession of philosophy. if they had let us alone in our natural being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they might then have reason to talk at that rate; but 'tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world; 'tis from them that we derive this fancy, ""that human reason is controller-general of all that is without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and understood."" this answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy the happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without aristotle's precepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. they need not tell us, ""it is true, for you see and feel it to be so;"" they must tell me whether i really feel what i think i do; and if i do feel it, they must then tell me why i feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, 'tis a test full of falsity, error, weakness, and defect. nl which way can we better prove it than by itself? if we are not to believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect of it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the almighty; there is her habitation and recess; 'tis thence that she imparts her rays, when god is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as balias issued from her father's head, to communicate herself to the world. nl now let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul, not of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which appertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:— nl                     ignoratur enim, qu sit natura animai; nl              nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur; nl              et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta; nl             an tenebras orci visat, vastasque lacunas, nl             an pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se. nl                 ""for none the nature of the soul doth know, nl             whether that it be born with us, or no; nl            or be infused into us at our birth, nl            and dies with us when we return to earth, nl            or then descends to the black shades below, nl            or into other animals does go."" nl crates and dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all, but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; plato, that it was a substance moving of itself; thales, a nature without repose; aedepiades, an exercising of the senses; hesiod and anaximander, a thing composed of earth and water; parmenides, of earth and fire; empedocles, of blood:— nl           sanguineam vomit ille animam; nl           ""he vomits up his bloody soul."" nl posidonius, cleanthes, and galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion— nl           igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo; nl            ""their vigour of fire and of heavenly race."" nl hippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; varro, that it was an air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart, and diffused throughout the whole body; zeno, the quintessence of the four elements; heraclides ponticus, that it was the light; zenocrates and the egyptians, a mobile number; the chaldeans, a virtue without any determinate form:— nl                habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse, nl           harmoniam grci quam dicunt. nl                ""a certain vital habit in man's frame, nl           which harmony the grecian sages name."" nl let us not forget aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect lactantius, seneca, and most of the dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand; after all this enumeration of opinions, harum sententiarum quo vera sit, deus aliquis viderit: ""of these opinions which is the true, let some god determine,"" says cicero. ""i know by myself,"" says st bernard, ""how incomprehensible god is, seeing i cannot comprehend the parts of my own being."" nl heraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound was the essence of it. nl neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it. hippocrates and hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain; democritus and aristotle throughout the whole body;— nl  nl                ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse nl            corporis, et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis; nl                 ""as when the body's health they do it call, nl           when of a sound man, that's no part at all."" nl epicurus in the stomach; nl                hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus; nl           hc loca circum ltiti mulcent. nl                ""for this the seat of horror is and fear, nl           and joys in turn do likewise triumph here."" nl the stoics, about and within the heart; erasistratus, adjoining the membrane of the epicranium; empedocles, in the blood; as also moses, which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts, because the soul is there seated; galen thought that every part of the body had its soul; strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; qu facie quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est: ""what figure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired into,"" says cicero. i very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should i alter eloquence itself? besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. but the reason why chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; ""it is,"" says he, ""because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies i, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach."" this place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. no human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. why do we fear to say? the stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. but the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change. nl the extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. the beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be ""a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of plato."" nl and what did the epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. and even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? ""if the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the iliad?""—""whatever is capable of reason,"" says zeno, ""is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason."" cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of zeno: ""the whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise."" there are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions. nl whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. i willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found. nl for my part, i am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. this same plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after socrates, ""that he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand."" by this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. they profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. they will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science. nl i advised a person in italy, who had a great mind to speak italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether latin, french, spanish, or gascon, and that, by adding the italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either tuscan, roman, venetian, piedmontese, or neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. i say the same of philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. ""nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers."" and i am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, i know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, ""see whence he took it!"" my manners are natural, i have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb i went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. i never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher. nl but to return to the soul. inasmuch as plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. and the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body nl                 medium non deserit unquam nl           coeli phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt. nl                 ""phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way; nl           yet all things doth illustrate with his ray."" nl as the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:— nl                ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus, nl            paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur. nl                ""the other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er nl           the body, does obey the reason's lore."" nl some have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:— nl                deum namque ire per omnes nl           terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum; nl           hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum, nl           quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas: nl           scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri nl           omnia; nec morti esse locum: nl                ""for god goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole nl           heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul; nl           each at its birth, from him all beings share, nl           both man and brute, the breath of vital air; nl           to him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain, nl           fly whence they sprung, and rest in god again, nl            spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay, nl            dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way."" nl others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers; nl                instillata patris virtus tibi; nl           fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis; nl                ""thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood: nl           for still the brave spring from the brave and good;"" nl and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:— nl                 denique cur acris violentia triste leonum nl           seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis nl           a patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitt artus? nl           si non certa suo quia semine seminioque nl           vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto. nl                ""for why should rage from the fierce lion's seed, nl           or from the subtle fox's craft, proceed; nl           or why the tim'rous and flying hart nl           his fear and trembling to his race impart; nl           but that a certain force of mind does grow, nl            and still increases as the bodies do?"" nl that thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children the faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the ill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had been some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory of their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:— nl                si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur, nl           cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus, nl           nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus? nl                ""for at our birth if it infused be, nl           why do we then retain no memory nl           of our foregoing life, and why no more nl           remember any thing we did before?"" nl for, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and purity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of the body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember, being got in the body, as plato said, ""that what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;"" a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. to say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:— nl                nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas, nl           omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum, nl           non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat. nl                ""for if the mind be changed to that degree nl           as of past things to lose all memory, nl           so great a change as that, i must confess, nl           appears to me than death but little less."" nl furthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account it had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. by this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of epicurus and democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:— nl                gigni pariter cum corpore, et una nl           crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem. nl                ""souls with the bodies to be born we may nl           discern, with them t' increase, with them decay."" nl they perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness; capable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and languor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the foot; nl                mentem sanari, corpus ut grum, nl             ceraimus, et flecti medicin posse videmus; nl                 ""sick minds, as well as bodies, we do see nl            by med'cine's virtue oft restored to be;"" nl dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some medicaments, and roused by others,— nl                corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est, nl            corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat; nl                ""there must be of necessity, we find, nl           a nature that's corporeal of the mind, nl           because we evidently see it smarts nl             and wounded is with shafts the body darts;"" nl they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability of reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents; the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge,— nl                vis.... animal conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum nl           disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno; nl                ""the power of the soul's disturbed; and when nl           that once is but sequestered from her, then nl            by the same poison 'tis dispersed abroad;"" nl and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:— nl               vis morbi distracta per artus nl           turbat agens animam, spumantes quore salso nl          ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und. nl               ""throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease nl          disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas, nl          the foaming waves to swell and boil we see, nl           stirred by the wind's impetuosity."" nl now, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in a philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled, overturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain. nl                 morbis in corporis avius errat nl           spe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur; nl           interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum nl          ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti: nl          ""for when the body's sick, and ill at ease, nl          the mind doth often share in the disease; nl           wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by nl          a heavy and a stupid lethargy, nl          is overcome and cast into a deep, nl          a most profound and everlasting sleep."" nl the philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more than another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: ""the soul is either mortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it will change for the better.""—they never touch the other branch, ""what if she change for the worse?"" and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments. but thereby they make themselves a good game. these are two omissions that i often meet with in their discourses. i return to the first. nl this soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and so firm. our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. as to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal, was unimaginable:— nl               quippe etenim mortale terao jungere, et una nl          consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse, nl          desipere est. quid enim diversius esse putandum est, nl          aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque, nl          quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni nl           junctum, in concilio, svas tolerare procellas? nl                ""the mortal and th' eternal, then, to blend, nl          and think they can pursue one common end, nl          is madness: for what things more diff'rent are. nl          distinct in nature, and disposed to jar? nl          how can it then be thought that these should bear, nl          when thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?"" nl moreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body:— nl          simul ovo fessa fatiscit: nl          ""fatigued together with the weight of years:"" nl which, according to zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it ""as a fainting and fall of the soul, as well as of the body:"" contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere: and, what they perceived in some, that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire:— nl               non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet gri, nl          in nullo caput interea sit forte dolore. nl               ""so, often of the gout a man complains, nl          whose head is, at the same time, free from pains."" nl the sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl's eyes are to the splendour of the sun, says aristotle. by what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? for the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by pherecydes nl syrius, in the time of king tullus (though some attribute it to thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and nl reservation. the most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the academy. no one doubts what aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: ""a thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers."" he conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself. nl two things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful nl repute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. he has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. the soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. but 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: ""they are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher,"" says one of the ancients. by which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. all things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that god wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of babel. whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. we corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. what course soever man takes of himself, god still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. ""i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."" the diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? this saint has very much obliged me: ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio ""the very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption."" to what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly! nl but to return to my subject. it was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to god only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. let us ingenuously confess that god alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. and whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. the more we give and confess to owe and render to god, we do it with the greater christianity. that which this stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from god? cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. utor hc public persuasione. ""when we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. i make use of this public persuasion."" now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. let us omit the stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. ""they give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,"") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. the most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: ""that souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;"" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that euphorbus, afterwards hermotimus, and, finally, from pyrrhus was passed into pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. and some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:— nl               o pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est nl          sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti nl           corpora? qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido? nl                 ""o, father, is it then to be conceiv'd nl          that any of these spirits, so sublime, nl          should hence to the celestial regions climb, nl           and thence return to earth to reassume nl           their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb? nl           for wretched life whence does such fondness come?"" nl origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate. the opinion that varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. observe her progress elsewhere: ""the soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with."" but i will not omit the objection the epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. for the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive. nl               denique comrabia ad veneris, partusque ferarum nl          esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur; nl          et spectare immortales mortalia membra nl          innumero numro, certareque prproperanter nl           inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter. nl               ""absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget, nl          or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait, nl          expect the falling body, fight and strive nl          which first shall enter in and make it live."" nl others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. some make it immortal, without nl sense or knowledge. there are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. ""we are told,"" says he, ""and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end."" but who desires to see him—him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, i refer him to his treatise of the moon, and of the demon of socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. see here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul. nl neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite socrates was, according to aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; epicurus, an extract from soul and body; aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? aristotle and democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, ""for what term women carry their fruit?"" and i, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. the world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree. nl here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part we have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. i think i have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. ""as if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own."" in earnest, protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. when thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible. nl you,* for whom i have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of persia, darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on, nl          * the author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing nl           margaret de valois. nl though he should run them both through at once. i have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. the portuguese, in the indian sea, took certain turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. we here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. remember the tuscan proverb:— nl           chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza. nl          ""who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool."" nl i advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; i am an enemy to all extravagant ways. you, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. but here is as much as you will stand in need of. nl epicurus said of the laws, ""that the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another."" and plato affirms, ""that without laws we should live like beasts."" our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. it is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. and yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. in earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. and therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. but if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company. nl the liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. but now that men go all one way, qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, ""who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,"" and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. in like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. we need to know no more but that mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of venus in the thumb, and that of mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. i leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies. nl theophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, i do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, i lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him, nl                ut hymettia sole nl          cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas nl           vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;

if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi: nl ""one thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same."" now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. if we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy, nl          mulciber in trojam, pro troj stabat apollo; nl          ""vulcan against, for troy apollo stood;"" nl when are we to expect that they will be agreed? we are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. if man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? it is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood. nl the academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. and to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. the pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? if our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect this appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. but why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? how should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot if our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: ""amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind."" that things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that i seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men. nl let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, i mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number. nl besides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. how variously do we judge of things?—how often do we alter our opinions? what i hold and believe to-day i hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; i could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than i do this; i am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which i have since judged to be false? a man must at least become wise at his own expense; if i have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can i now have more than at other times? is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all. nl     posterior.... res ilia reperta nl          perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne. nl          ""the last things we find out are always best, nl           and make us to disrelish all the rest."" nl whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it the things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if god for this end did not prepare it, if god did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. at least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived. nl now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. it is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? do you believe that catullus's verses, or those of sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? cleomenes, the son of anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; ""i believe it,"" said he; ""neither am i the same man now as when i am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before."" in our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, gaudeat de bon fortun ; ""let him rejoice in his good fortune;"" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. that venerable senate of the areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. the very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in cicero:— nl               tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse nl          jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras. nl               ""men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air, nl          dark or serene, as days are foul or fair."" nl 'tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,—the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that i believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order. nl as to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. i always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. how uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip. nl i, that watch myself as narrowly as i can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere, nl               quis sub arcto rex gelid metuatur or, nl          quid tyridatem terreat, unice securus, nl               ""i care not whom the northern clime reveres, nl          or what's the king that tyridates fears,"" nl dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness i find in myself my foot is so unstable and unsteady, i find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, i am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, i am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, i am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. the same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: i am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. i have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either i am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, i am as merry as a cricket. when i take a book in hand i have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, i may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. even in my own writings i do not always find the air of my first fancy; i know not what i would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because i have lost the first that was better. i do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams:— nl               velut minuta magno nl          deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento. nl              ""like a small bark that's tost upon the main. nl          when winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain."" nl very often, as i am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that i no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it i am, as it were, misled by the side to which i incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as i do. preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. you only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. nay, i do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. the shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. and whoever should maintain this, siding with the peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; semper ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; ""ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:"" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice. nl irregular desires moved themistocles, and demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. and this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of god, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! in short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. may not this be one of the reasons that moved the epicureans to discharge god from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. ""as it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it."" nl what varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! what assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? if our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it? nl is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? we better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. the two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep. nl this is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. i was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. but does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed? nl i, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. but the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. i have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for i am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that i do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; i perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as i was, wholly to seize and possess me. so that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; i evidently saw the advantages of the object i desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, i was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? pyrrho knows nothing about it. we are never without sickness. agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as i had advanced, so much i retired:— nl               qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus, nl          nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam nl          spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam; nl          nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens nl          saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit. nl               ""so swelling surges, with a thundering roar, nl          driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore, nl          bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land, nl          and far upon the beach heave up the sand; nl          then backward rapidly they take their way, nl          repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea."" nl now, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, i have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, i do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as i am not capable of choosing, i take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein god has placed me; i could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. thus have i, by the grace of god, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. the writings of the ancients, the best authors i mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that i am reading seems always to have the most force; and i find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. the facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. the heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till cleanthes the samian, or, according to theophrastus, nicetas of syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. and copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? and who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former. nl               sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum: nl          quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore; nl          porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit, nl          inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum nl          laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore. nl                ""thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time, nl           what now is valued passes soon its prime; nl          to which some other thing, despised before, nl           succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more; nl          and once received, too faint all praises seem, nl          so highly it is rais'd in men's esteem."" nl so that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. before the principles that aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. what patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? they are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. when any one presses me with a new argument, i ought to believe that what i cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. he that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. how long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'tis said that a new comer, called paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. i believe he will easily make this good, but i do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. we are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. a man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if i would give him the hearing. after i had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: ""what, then,"" said i, ""did those that sailed according to theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?"" ""that's fortune,"" answered he, ""but so it is that they were mistaken."" i replied that i had rather follow effects than reason. now these are things that often interfere with one another, and i have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as jacques pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. and the pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. the geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:— nl          nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur; nl          ""what's present pleases, and appears the best;"" nl but it remains to be seen whether, as ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? and whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine. nl plato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west the egyptian priests told herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; aristotle and cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling solomon and isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that god has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. in the most famous of the greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. and apuleius says of men: sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. ""that they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general."" alexander writ to his mother the narration of an egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. cicero and diodorus say that in their time the chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, aristotle, pliny, and others, that zoroaster flourished six thousand years before plato's time. plato says that they of the city of sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of athens was built a thousand years before the said city of sais; epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the west indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples. nl in earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, i have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. the human mind is a great worker of miracles! but this relation has, moreover, i know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of st andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. in one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one god, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words: nl ""from dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;"" as also the art of augury. the vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. it is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. and this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the mahometan and jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. but to proceed:— nl if nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? if we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: ""the climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,"" says vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the egyptian priests told solon: athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur attici; crassum thebis; itaque pingues thebani, et valentes: ""the air of athens is subtle and thin; whence also the athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong."" in such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why cyrus would not grant the persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. if we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so? nl methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:— nl               quid enim ratione timemus, nl           aut cupimus? quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te nl          conatus non poniteat, votique peracti? nl               ""for what, with reason, do we speak or shun, nl          what plan, how happily soe'r begun, nl          that, when achieved, we do not wish undone?"" nl and therefore it was that socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private and public prayer of the lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the supreme power:— nl               conjugium petimus, partumqu uxoris;

his prayer was heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers. nl               attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque, nl          effugere optt opes, et, qu modo voverat, odit. nl               ""astonished at the strangeness of the ill, nl          to be so rich, yet miserable still;

instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and lower. cleobis and bito, trophonius and agamedes, having requested, the first of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of their piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us. god might grant us riches, honours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us. if he sends us death, or an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, vvrga tua et baculus, tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. ""thy rod and thy staff have comforted me,"" he does it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it in good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand nl               si consilium vis: nl          permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid nl          conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris... nl          carior est illis homo quam sibi; nl               ""if thou'lt be rul'd, to th' gods thy fortunes trust, nl          their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just. nl          what best may profit or delight they know, nl          and real good, for fancied bliss, bestow; nl          with eyes of pity, they our frailties scan, nl          more dear to them, than to himself, is man;"" nl for to require of him honours and commands, is to require 'that he may throw you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of the like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit doubtful. nl there is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers, as about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the calculation of varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. qui autem de summo bono dissentit, de tot philosophies ratione disputt.

""that we follow the laws of our country;"" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; i cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. what kind of virtue is that which i see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? what sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them? nl but they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest now they are so unfortunate, (for what can i call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, i say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. but let them produce me one of this condition. proctagoras and aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; thrasymachus, in plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. there is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:— nl               gentes esse ferantur, nl          in quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti nl          jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore; nl               ""there are some nations in the world, 'tis said, nl          where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed; nl          and their affections thereby higher rise, nl          more firm and constant by these double ties;"" nl the murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other. nl it is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: ""therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art."" subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view. nl there is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. it is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms. nl lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods. nl dionysius, the tyrant, offered plato a robe of the persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; plato refused it, saying, ""that being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;"" but aristippus accepted it with this answer, ""that no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage."" his friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that dionysius had spit in his face, ""fishermen,"" said he, ""suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon."" diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, ""if thou couldst live on cabbage,"" said he, ""thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;"" to whom aristippus replied, ""and if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages."" thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:— nl               bellum, o terra hospita, portas: nl          bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur. nl          sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti nl          quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;

""why,"" replied he, ""hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?"" we have our ears bored; the greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. we retire in private to enjoy our wives; the indians do it in public. the scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere temples were a refuge:— nl                inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum nl          odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos nl          esse deos, quos ipse colit. nl               ""thus 'tis the popular fury that creates nl          that all their neighbours' gods each nation hates; nl          each thinks its own the genuine; in a word, nl          the only deities to be adored."" nl i have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt bartolus and aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties, writ in the margin of his book, ""a question for a friend;"" that is to say, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit 'twas only for want of wit that he did not write ""a question for a friend"" throughout. the advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. in so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause. nl as to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. arcesilaus said, ""that in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:"" et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. ""and obscene pleasures, if nature requires them,"" epicurus thinks, ""are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved."" these last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that dicarchus threw into the teeth of plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom. nl laws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable, nl that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. it is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. chrysippus said, ""that a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives."" nl that philosopher would hardly have advised clisthenes to have refused hippoclides the fair agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the peripatetics, of which he had been till then. that which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. the other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:— nl               mochus es aufidi, qui vir, nl          scvine, fuisti: nl          rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est. nl           cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor? nl          numquid securus non potes arrigere? nl this experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:— nl               nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet nl          uxorem gratis, cciliane, tuam, nl          dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens nl          turba fututorum est. ingeniosus homo es. nl a philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, ""i am planting man;"" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic. nl it is, i suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. but he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. to those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, ""because i am hungry in the open street."" the women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and hipparchia was not received into crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. these philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others. nl heraclitus and protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing. nl this opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! what heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. a person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science. nl by this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. there is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the sibyls, say what he will. there are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;—a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. this it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please. nl is it possible that homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. and what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. do but observe how plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. they draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. from the same foundation that heraclitus and this sentence of his had, ""that all things had in them those forms that we discern,"" democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,—""that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;"" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. the pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. the cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat protagoras believed that ""what seems true to every one, is true to every one."" the epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation. nl this discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and prof of our ignorance. whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:— nl                 via qua munita fidei nl           proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis; nl               ""it is the surest path that faith can find nl          by which to enter human heart and mind."" nl science begins by them, and is resolved into them. after all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. he that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. the senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:— nl                invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam nl           notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli.... nl            quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi debet? nl               ""of truth, whate'er discoveries are made, nl           are by the senses to us first conveyed; nl          nor will one sense be baffled; for on what nl          can we rely more safely than on that?"" nl let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. cicero says, that chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: ""o miserable! thy force has destroyed thee."" there can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty. nl the first consideration i have upon the subject of the senses is that i make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. i see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? for if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:— nl                  an poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures nl             tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris? nl           an confutabunt nares, oculive revincent? nl                 ""can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct? nl            or is that touch by tasting to be check'd? nl           or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes nl            confute in their peculiar faculties?"" nl they all make the extremest limits of our ability:— nl                seorsum cuique potestas divisa est, sua vis cuique est, nl               ""each has its power distinctly and alone, nl          and every sense's power is its own."" nl it is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. it is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all. nl i have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. they brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, ""good god,"" said he, ""what a fine child! how beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!"" he will say, like one of us, ""this room has a very fine prospect;—it is clear weather;—the sun shines bright."" and moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. one cries out to him, ""here's a hare!"" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, ""the hare is killed,"" he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. he will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide. nl who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? what do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? we seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. there is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. if we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. we have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence. nl the sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. from this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: ""that every subject has in itself all we there find. that it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;"" and that of the epicureans, ""that the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:—"" nl                 quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura, nl          quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur: nl               ""but be it what it will in our esteems, nl          it is no bigger than to us it seems:"" nl that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:— nl               nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum.... nl          proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli: nl               ""yet that the eye's deluded we deny; nl          charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:"" nl ""and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses."" timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. the most absurd of all absurdities, with the epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:— nl                   proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est nl             et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam, nl             cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint nl             visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem nl             beddere mendose causas utriusque figur, nl            quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam, nl             et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota nl             fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque: nl             non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa nl            concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis, nl             procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint nl            in genere hoc fugienda. nl                 ""that what we see exists i will maintain, nl           and if our feeble reason can't explain nl             why things seem square when they are very near, nl             and at a greater distance round appear; nl            'tis better yet, for him that's at a pause, nl           't' assign to either figure a false cause, nl           than shock his faith, and the foundations rend nl          on which our safety and our life depend: nl          for reason not alone, but life and all, nl          together will with sudden ruin fall; nl          unless we trust our senses, nor despise nl          to shun the various dangers that arise."" nl this so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him. he cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. in case what the epicureans say be true, viz: ""that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;"" and if that also be true which the stoics say, ""that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,"" we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all. nl as to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. in the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:— nl               exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes, nl          classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem nl          apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens nl          insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur... nl          et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur, nl          qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus.... nl          ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit nl          flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur nl          vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim. nl                ""and rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head, nl          though far disjoined, though royal navies spread, nl          their sails between; yet if from distance shown, nl          they seem an island all combin'd in one. nl          thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale, nl          seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail nl          that ride at anchor safe; and all admire, nl          as they row by, to see the rocks retire. nl          thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood, nl          and i look'd downward on the rolling flood; nl          though he stood still, i thought he did divide nl          the headlong streams, and strive against the tide, nl          and all things seem'd to move on every side."" nl take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. i set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—""that the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue."" there is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. for my part i do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of horace or catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and zeno had reason to say ""that the voice was the flower of beauty."" one would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. and therefore philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, ""i break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine."" to what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? and that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from spain, and this pearl-powder from the ocean sea. our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:— nl                auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur nl          crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni. nl          spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras: nl          decipit hac oculos gide dives amor. nl                ""by dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades nl           make up the pageant that your heart invades; nl           in all that glittering figure which you see, nl          the far least part of her own self is she; nl          in vain for her you love amidst such cost nl          you search, the mistress in such dress is lost."" nl what a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow, nl               cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse; nl          se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur; nl          dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet: nl               ""admireth all; for which to be admired; nl          and inconsiderately himself desir'd. nl          the praises which he gives his beauty claim'd, nl          who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:"" nl and pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman! nl               oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque, nl          et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;

he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. i have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though i am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, i was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though i stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless i would. where i also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: ""'to that one cannot look without dizziness;"" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. and therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, ""for it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear."" physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. i have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. of what use was that piping prompter of gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? in earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind. nl the same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. what we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:— nl                et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere thebas. nl               ""thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns."" nl the object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is; nl               multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus nl          esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere; nl               ""hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress nl          seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;"" nl and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts? nl                in rebus quoque apertis noscere possis, nl          si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni nl          tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot: nl                ""nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind nl          take heed, unless she sets herself to find, nl          the thing no more is seen, no more belov'd, nl          than if the most obscure and most remov'd:"" nl it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. and so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood. nl they who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. when we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and cimmerian darkness. we wake sleeping, and sleep waking. i do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, i never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep? nl if the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. but betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:— nl               tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est, nl           ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum. nl          spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv, nl          disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa: nl                ""and in those things the difference is so great nl          that what's one's poison is another's meat; nl          for serpents often have been seen, 'tis said, nl          when touch'd with human spittle, to go mad, nl          and bite themselves to death:"" nl what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? by which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for? nl pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them. which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? one quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? to them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:— nl               lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur arquati. nl                ""besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view nl          looks pale as well as those, and yellow too."" nl they who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody. what do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. when we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. if we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:— nl                bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis... nl          et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina. nl               ""one lamp seems double, and the men appear nl          each on two bodies double heads to bear."" nl if our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. we see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:— nl               et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela, nl          et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris, nl          per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent; nl          namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem nl          scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque nl          inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore: nl               ""thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red, nl          o'er all the spacious theatre are spread, nl          which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear, nl          and the loose curtains wanton in the air; nl          whole streams of colours from the summit flow, nl          the rays divide them in their passage through, nl          and stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:"" nl 'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes. nl we should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. a child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. the senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. we receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come so a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. what! do our senses themselves hinder one another? a picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? there are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. they who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,—whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? as we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:— nl                 ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes, nl         disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se; nl                 ""as meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose nl         their former state, and different things compose;"" nl the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, i would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? and upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? he whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:— nl                  denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima, nl          normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit, nl          et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum; nl         omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est, nl         prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta; nl         jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque nl         prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis; nl         sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est, nl         falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est. nl                 ""but lastly, as in building, if the line nl         be not exact and straight, the rule decline, nl         or level false, how vain is the design! nl         uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall nl         must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall, nl         because the rules were false that fashion'd all; nl         thus reason's rules are false if all commence nl         and rise from failing and from erring sense."" nl as to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? as we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. we must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was. nl to judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. and to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? as they who never knew socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation. nl we have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. so, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that homer had made the ocean and thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:— nl              mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas, nl         ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet; nl         nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant, nl         omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit. nl             ""for time the nature of the world translates, nl         and from preceding gives all things new states; nl         nought like itself remains, but all do range, nl         and nature forces every thing to change."" nl ""and yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. and that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? how comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? how comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? for it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. but what is it then that truly is? that which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. for time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. and as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. the same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. so that it were sinful to say of god, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that god alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end."" to this so religious conclusion of a pagan i shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: ""what a vile and abject thing,"" says he, ""is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!"" 'tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. he shall be exalted, if god will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. it belongs to our christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis."
13,Ted Fresco,Sunny Day,"                                                            i nl     it was by accident that babbitt had his opportunity to address the s. a. r. e. b. nl     the s. a. r. e. b., as its members called it, with the universal passion for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the state association of real estate boards; the organization of brokers and operators. it was to hold its annual convention at monarch, zenith's chief rival among the cities of the state. babbitt was an official delegate; another was cecil rountree, whom babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building, and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest dances on royal ridge. rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee. nl     babbitt had growled to him, ""makes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' a good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em."" nl     ""right you are! i say: why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at the s. a. r. e. b.?"" suggested rountree. nl     ""well, if it would help you in making up the program—tell you: the way i look at it is this: first place, we ought to insist that folks call us 'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' sounds more like a reg'lar profession. second place—what is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade, business, or occupation? what is it? why, it's the public service and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all that, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never considers the-public service and trained skill and so on. now as a professional—"" nl     ""rather! that's perfectly bully! perfectly corking! now you write it in a paper,"" said rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away. nl     ii nl     however accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and correspondence, babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read. nl     he laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife's collapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. the household had been bullied into silence; verona and ted requested to disappear, and tinka threatened with ""if i hear one sound out of you—if you holler for a glass of water one single solitary time—you better not, that's all!"" mrs. babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown and gazing with respect while babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table. nl     when he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she marveled, ""i don't see how you can just sit down and make up things right out of your own head!"" nl     ""oh, it's the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in modern business life."" nl     he had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth: nl     {illustration omitted: consists of several doodles and ""(1) a profession (2) not just a trade crossed out (3) skill & vision (3) shd be called ""realtor"" & not just real est man""} nl     the other six pages were rather like the first. nl     for a week he went about looking important. every morning, as he dressed, he thought aloud: ""jever stop to consider, myra, that before a town can have buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some realtor has got to sell 'em the land? all civilization starts with him. jever realize that?"" at the athletic club he led unwilling men aside to inquire, ""say, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all through?"" he asked howard littlefield for a ""set of statistics about real-estate sales; something good and impressive,"" and littlefield provided something exceedingly good and impressive. nl     but it was to t. cholmondeley frink that babbitt most often turned. he caught frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while frink looked hunted and evasive, ""say, chum—you're a shark on this writing stuff—how would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript—manuscript now where the deuce is that?—oh, yes, here. would you say 'we ought not also to alone think?' or 'we ought also not to think alone?' or—"" nl     one evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, babbitt forgot about style, order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off what he really thought about the real-estate business and about himself, and he found the paper written. when he read it to his wife she yearned, ""why, dear, it's splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and interesting, and such splendid ideas! why, it's just—it's just splendid!"" nl     next day he cornered chum frink and crowed, ""well, old son, i finished it last evening! just lammed it out! i used to think you writing-guys must have a hard job making up pieces, but lord, it's a cinch. pretty soft for you fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! some day when i get ready to retire, guess i'll take to writing and show you boys how to do it. i always used to think i could write better stuff, and more punch and originality, than all this stuff you see printed, and now i'm doggone sure of it!"" nl     he had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title, had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to old ira runyon, the managing editor of the advocate-times, who said yes, indeed yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would read it all through—as soon as he could find time. nl     mrs. babbitt could not go to monarch. she had a women's-club meeting. babbitt said that he was very sorry. nl     iii nl     besides the five official delegates to the convention—babbitt, rountree, w. a. rogers, alvin thayer, and elbert wing—there were fifty unofficial delegates, most of them with their wives. nl     they met at the union station for the midnight train to monarch. all of them, save cecil rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore badges, displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered ""we zoom for zenith."" the official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta ribbons. martin lumsen's little boy willy carried a tasseled banner inscribed ""zenith the zip city—zeal, zest and zowie—1,000,000 in 1935."" as the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family automobile driven by the oldest son or by cousin fred, they formed impromptu processions through the station waiting-room. nl     it was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and frescoes depicting the exploration of the chaloosa river valley by pere emile fauthoux in 1740. the benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany; the news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. down the echoing spaces of the hall the delegates paraded after willy lumsen's banner, the men waving their cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks and strings of beads, all singing to the tune of auld lang syne the official city song, written by chum frink: nl         good old zenith, nl         our kin and kith, nl         wherever we may be, nl         hats in the ring, nl         we blithely sing nl         of thy prosperity. nl     warren whitby, the broker, who had a gift of verse for banquets and birthdays, had added to frink's city song a special verse for the realtors' convention: nl         oh, here we come, nl         the fellows from nl         zenith, the zip citee. nl         we wish to state nl         in real estate nl         there's none so live as we. nl     babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. he leaped on a bench, shouting to the crowd: nl     ""what's the matter with zenith?"" nl     ""she's all right!"" nl     ""what's best ole town in the u. s. a.?"" nl     ""zeeeeeen-ith!"" nl     the patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious wonder—italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes, roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new but which were faded now and wrinkled. nl     babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified. with wing and rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the waiting pullmans. motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity. arc-lights glared and stammered overhead. the glossy yellow sleeping-cars shone impressively. babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he thrust out his abdomen and rumbled, ""we got to see to it that the convention lets the legislature understand just where they get off in this matter of taxing realty transfers."" wing uttered approving grunts and babbitt swelled—gloated. nl     the blind of a pullman compartment was raised, and babbitt looked into an unfamiliar world. the occupant of the compartment was lucile mckelvey, the pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. possibly, babbitt thrilled, she was going to europe! on the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed foreign. while he stared, she picked up the book, then glanced out of the window as though she was bored. she must have looked straight at him, and he had met her, but she gave no sign. she languidly pulled down the blind, and he stood still, a cold feeling of insignificance in his heart. nl     but on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from sparta, pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened respectfully when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of zenith, he explained politics and the value of a good sound business administration. they fell joyfully into shop-talk, the purest and most rapturous form of conversation: nl     ""how'd this fellow rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he was going to put up? whadde do? get out bonds to finance it?"" asked a sparta broker. nl     ""well, i'll tell you,"" said babbitt. ""now if i'd been handling it—"" nl     ""so,"" elbert wing was droning, ""i hired this shop-window for a week, and put up a big sign, 'toy town for tiny tots,' and stuck in a lot of doll houses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, 'baby likes this dollydale, but papa and mama will prefer our beautiful bungalows,' and you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first week we sold—"" nl     the trucks sang ""lickety-lick, lickety-lick"" as the train ran through the factory district. furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were clanging. red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past, and babbitt was important again, and eager. nl     iv nl     he did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the train. in the morning, half an hour before they reached monarch, the porter came to his berth and whispered, ""there's a drawing-room vacant, sir. i put your suit in there."" in tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, babbitt slipped down the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first private compartment. the porter indicated that he knew babbitt was used to a man-servant; he held the ends of babbitt's trousers, that the beautifully sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the private washroom, and waited with a towel. nl     to have a private washroom was luxurious. however enlivening a pullman smoking-compartment was by night, even to babbitt it was depressing in the morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts, every hook filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled with dingy toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste. babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but now he reveled in it, reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a tip of a dollar and a half. nl     he rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed clothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked at monarch. nl     he was to share a room at the hotel sedgwick with w. a. rogers, that shrewd, rustic-looking zenith dealer in farm-lands. together they had a noble breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in large pots. babbitt grew expansive, and told rogers about the art of writing; he gave a bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the lobby, and sent to tinka a post-card: ""papa wishes you were here to bat round with him."" nl     v nl     the meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of the allen house. in an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the executive committee. he was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that he got nothing done whatever. he sat at a marquetry table, in a room littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, ""yes, yes, that's a fine idea; we'll do that,"" and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching, ""say, mr. chairman—say, mr. chairman!"" without penetrating his exhausted hearing. nl     in the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of sparta, pictures of the new state capitol, at galop de vache, and large ears of corn with the label, ""nature's gold, from shelby county, the garden spot of god's own country."" nl the real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in groups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a show of public meetings. nl     the first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of monarch. the pastor of the first christian church of monarch, a large man with a long damp frontal lock, informed god that the real-estate men were here now. nl     the venerable minnemagantic realtor, major carlton tuke, read a paper in which he denounced cooperative stores. william a. larkin of eureka gave a comforting prognosis of ""the prospects for increased construction,"" and reminded them that plate-glass prices were two points lower. nl     the convention was on. nl     the delegates were entertained, incessantly and firmly. the monarch chamber of commerce gave them a banquet, and the manufacturers' association an afternoon reception, at which a chrysanthemum was presented to each of the ladies, and to each of the men a leather bill-fold inscribed ""from monarch the mighty motor mart."" nl     mrs. crosby knowlton, wife of the manufacturer of fleetwing automobiles, opened her celebrated italian garden and served tea. six hundred real-estate men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths. perhaps three hundred of them were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred vigorously exclaimed, ""this is pretty slick, eh?"" surreptitiously picked the late asters and concealed them in their pockets, and tried to get near enough to mrs. knowlton to shake her lovely hand. without request, the zenith delegates (except rountree) gathered round a marble dancing nymph and sang ""here we come, the fellows from zenith, the zip citee."" nl     it chanced that all the delegates from pioneer belonged to the brotherly and protective order of elks, and they produced an enormous banner lettered: ""b. p. o. e.—best people on earth—boost pioneer, oh eddie."" nor was galop de vache, the state capital, to be slighted. the leader of the galop de vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish man, but active. he took off his coat, hurled his broad black felt hat on the ground, rolled up his sleeves, climbed upon the sundial, spat, and bellowed: nl     ""we'll tell the world, and the good lady who's giving the show this afternoon, that the bonniest burg in this man's state is galop de vache. you boys can talk about your zip, but jus' lemme murmur that old galop has the largest proportion of home-owning citizens in the state; and when folks own their homes, they ain't starting labor-troubles, and they're raising kids instead of raising hell! galop de vache! the town for homey folks! the town that eats 'em alive oh, bosco! we'll—tell—the—world!"" nl     the guests drove off; the garden shivered into quiet. but mrs. crosby knowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred summers of amalfi. on the face of a winged sphinx which supported it some one had drawn a mustache in lead-pencil. crumpled paper napkins were dumped among the michaelmas daisies. on the walk, like shredded lovely flesh, were the petals of the last gallant rose. cigarette stubs floated in the goldfish pool, trailing an evil stain as they swelled and disintegrated, and beneath the marble seat, the fragments carefully put together, was a smashed teacup. nl     vi nl     as he rode back to the hotel babbitt reflected, ""myra would have enjoyed all this social agony."" for himself he cared less for the garden party than for the motor tours which the monarch chamber of commerce had arranged. indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban trolley-stations, and tanneries. he devoured the statistics which were given to him, and marveled to his roommate, w. a. rogers, ""of course this town isn't a patch on zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural resources; but did you know—i nev' did till to-day—that they manufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last year? what d' you think of that!"" nl     he was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. when he stood on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw only a purple haze. but he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. they shouted ""that's the stuff!"" and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to ""our friend and brother, mr. george f. babbitt."" he had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, cecil rountree. after the meeting, delegates from all over the state said, ""hower you, brother babbitt?"" sixteen complete strangers called him ""george,"" and three men took him into corners to confide, ""mighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the profession a real boost. now i've always maintained—"" nl     next morning, with tremendous casualness, babbitt asked the girl at the hotel news-stand for the newspapers from zenith. there was nothing in the press, but in the advocate-times, on the third page—he gasped. they had printed his picture and a half-column account. the heading was ""sensation at annual land-men's convention. g. f. babbitt, prominent ziptown realtor, keynoter in fine address."" nl     he murmured reverently, ""i guess some of the folks on floral heights will sit up and take notice now, and pay a little attention to old georgie!"" nl     vii nl     it was the last meeting. the delegations were presenting the claims of their several cities to the next year's convention. orators were announcing that ""galop de vache, the capital city, the site of kremer college and of the upholtz knitting works, is the recognized center of culture and high-class enterprise;"" and that ""hamburg, the big little city with the logical location, where every man is open-handed and every woman a heaven-born hostess, throws wide to you her hospitable gates."" nl     in the midst of these more diffident invitations, the golden doors of the ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets, and a circus parade rolled in. it was composed of the zenith brokers, dressed as cowpunchers, bareback riders, japanese jugglers. at the head was big warren whitby, in the bearskin and gold-and-crimson coat of a drum-major. behind him, as a clown, beating a bass drum, extraordinarily happy and noisy, was babbitt. nl     warren whitby leaped on the platform, made merry play with his baton, and observed, ""boyses and girlses, the time has came to get down to cases. a dyed-in-the-wool zenithite sure loves his neighbors, but we've made up our minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like we've grabbed the condensed-milk business and the paper-box business and—"" nl     j. harry barmhill, the convention chairman, hinted, ""we're grateful to you, mr. uh, but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their bids now."" nl     a fog-horn voice blared, ""in eureka we'll promise free motor rides through the prettiest country—"" nl     running down the aisle, clapping his hands, a lean bald young man cried, ""i'm from sparta! our chamber of commerce has wired me they've set aside eight thousand dollars, in real money, for the entertainment of the convention!"" nl     a clerical-looking man rose to clamor, ""money talks! move we accept the bid from sparta!"" nl     it was accepted. nl     viii nl     the committee on resolutions was reporting. they said that whereas almighty god in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a sphere of higher usefulness some thirty-six realtors of the state the past year, therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that they were sorry god had done it, and the secretary should be, and hereby was, instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes, and to console the bereaved families by sending them each a copy. nl     a second resolution authorized the president of the s.a.r.e.b. to spend fifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the state legislature. this resolution had a good deal to say about menaces to sound business and clearing the wheels of progress from ill-advised and shortsighted obstacles. nl     the committee on committees reported, and with startled awe babbitt learned that he had been appointed a member of the committee on torrens titles. nl     he rejoiced, ""i said it was going to be a great year! georgie, old son, you got big things ahead of you! you're a natural-born orator and a good mixer and—zowie!"" nl     ix nl     there was no formal entertainment provided for the last evening. babbitt had planned to go home, but that afternoon the jered sassburgers of pioneer suggested that babbitt and w. a. rogers have tea with them at the catalpa inn. nl     teas were not unknown to babbitt—his wife and he earnestly attended them at least twice a year—but they were sufficiently exotic to make him feel important. he sat at a glass-covered table in the art room of the inn, with its painted rabbits, mottoes lettered on birch bark, and waitresses being artistic in dutch caps; he ate insufficient lettuce sandwiches, and was lively and naughty with mrs. sassburger, who was as smooth and large-eyed as a cloak-model. sassburger and he had met two days before, so they were calling each other ""georgie"" and ""sassy."" nl     sassburger said prayerfully, ""say, boys, before you go, seeing this is the last chance, i've got it, up in my room, and miriam here is the best little mixelogist in the stati unidos like us italians say."" nl     with wide flowing gestures, babbitt and rogers followed the sassburgers to their room. mrs. sassburger shrieked, ""oh, how terrible!"" when she saw that she had left a chemise of sheer lavender crepe on the bed. she tucked it into a bag, while babbitt giggled, ""don't mind us; we're a couple o' little divvils!"" nl     sassburger telephoned for ice, and the bell-boy who brought it said, prosaically and unprompted, ""highball glasses or cocktail?"" miriam sassburger mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal, nakedly white water-pitchers which exist only in hotels. when they had finished the first round she proved by intoning ""think you boys could stand another—you got a dividend coming"" that, though she was but a woman, she knew the complete and perfect rite of cocktail-drinking. nl     outside, babbitt hinted to rogers, ""say, w. a., old rooster, it comes over me that i could stand it if we didn't go back to the lovin' wives, this handsome abend, but just kind of stayed in monarch and threw a party, heh?"" nl     ""george, you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness. el wing's wife has gone on to pittsburg. let's see if we can't gather him in."" nl     at half-past seven they sat in their room, with elbert wing and two up-state delegates. their coats were off, their vests open, their faces red, their voices emphatic. they were finishing a bottle of corrosive bootlegged whisky and imploring the bell-boy, ""say, son, can you get us some more of this embalming fluid?"" they were smoking large cigars and dropping ashes and stubs on the carpet. with windy guffaws they were telling stories. they were, in fact, males in a happy state of nature. nl     babbitt sighed, ""i don't know how it strikes you hellions, but personally i like this busting loose for a change, and kicking over a couple of mountains and climbing up on the north pole and waving the aurora borealis around."" nl     the man from sparta, a grave, intense youngster, babbled, ""say! i guess i'm as good a husband as the run of the mill, but god, i do get so tired of going home every evening, and nothing to see but the movies. that's why i go out and drill with the national guard. i guess i got the nicest little wife in my burg, but—say! know what i wanted to do as a kid? know what i wanted to do? nl     wanted to be a big chemist. tha's what i wanted to do. but dad chased me out on the road selling kitchenware, and here i'm settled down—settled for life—not a chance! oh, who the devil started this funeral talk? how 'bout 'nother lil drink? 'and a-noth-er drink wouldn' do 's 'ny harmmmmmmm.'"" nl     ""yea. cut the sob-stuff,"" said w. a. rogers genially. ""you boys know i'm the village songster? come on nowsing up: nl         said the old obadiah to the young obadiah, nl         'i am dry, obadiah, i am dry.' nl         said the young obadiah to the old obadiah, nl         'so am i, obadiah, so am i.'"" nl     x nl     they had dinner in the moorish grillroom of the hotel sedgwick. somewhere, somehow, they seemed to have gathered in two other comrades: a manufacturer of fly-paper and a dentist. they all drank whisky from tea-cups, and they were humorous, and never listened to one another, except when w. a. rogers ""kidded"" the italian waiter. nl     ""say, gooseppy,"" he said innocently, ""i want a couple o' fried elephants' ears."" nl     ""sorry, sir, we haven't any."" nl     ""huh? no elephants' ears? what do you know about that!"" rogers turned to babbitt. ""pedro says the elephants' ears are all out!"" nl     ""well, i'll be switched!"" said the man from sparta, with difficulty hiding his laughter. nl     ""well, in that case, carlo, just bring me a hunk o' steak and a couple o' bushels o' french fried potatoes and some peas,"" rogers went on. ""i suppose back in dear old sunny it' the eyetalians get their fresh garden peas out of the can."" nl     ""no, sir, we have very nice peas in italy."" nl     ""is that a fact! georgie, do you hear that? they get their fresh garden peas out of the garden, in italy! by golly, you live and learn, don't you, antonio, you certainly do live and learn, if you live long enough and keep your strength. all right, garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with about two printers'-reams of french fried spuds on the promenade deck, comprehenez-vous, michelovitch angeloni?"" nl     afterward elbert wing admired, ""gee, you certainly did have that poor dago going, w. a. he couldn't make you out at all!"" nl     in the monarch herald, babbitt found an advertisement which he read aloud, to applause and laughter: nl old colony theatre nl     shake the old dogs to the wrollicking wrens the bonniest bevy of beauteous bathing babes in burlesque. pete menutti and his oh, gee, kids. nl     this is the straight steer, benny, the painless chicklets of the wrollicking wrens are the cuddlingest bunch that ever hit town. steer the feet, get the card board, and twist the pupils to the pdqest show ever. you will get 111% on your kale in this fun-fest. the calroza sisters are sure some lookers and will give you a run for your gelt. jock silbersteen is one of the pepper lads and slips you a dose of real laughter. shoot the up and down to jackson and west for graceful tappers. they run 1-2 under the wire. provin and adams will blow the blues in their laugh skit ""hootch mon!"" something doing, boys. listen to what the hep bird twitters. nl     ""sounds like a juicy show to me. let's all take it in,"" said babbitt. nl     but they put off departure as long as they could. they were safe while they sat here, legs firmly crossed under the table, but they felt unsteady; they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of the grillroom under the eyes of the other guests and the too-attentive waiters. nl     when they did venture, tables got in their way, and they sought to cover embarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom. as the girl handed out their hats, they smiled at her, and hoped that she, a cool and expert judge, would feel that they were gentlemen. they croaked at one another, ""who owns the bum lid?"" and ""you take a good one, george; i'll take what's left,"" and to the check-girl they stammered, ""better come along, sister! high, wide, and fancy evening ahead!"" all of them tried to tip her, urging one another, ""no! wait! here! i got it right here!"" among them, they gave her three dollars. nl     xi nl     flamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the burlesque show, their feet up on the rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more elementary chorus-evolutions, and a jewish comedian made vicious fun of jews. in the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. a dozen of them went in taxicabs out to bright blossom inn, where the blossoms were made of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable no longer wisely used. nl     here, whisky was served openly, in glasses. two or three clerks, who on pay-day longed to be taken for millionaires, sheepishly danced with telephone-girls and manicure-girls in the narrow space between the tables. fantastically whirled the professionals, a young man in sleek evening-clothes and a slim mad girl in emerald silk, with amber hair flung up as jaggedly as flames. babbitt tried to dance with her. he shuffled along the floor, too bulky to be guided, his steps unrelated to the rhythm of the jungle music, and in his staggering he would have fallen, had she not held him with supple kindly strength. he was blind and deaf from prohibition-era alcohol; he could not see the tables, the faces. but he was overwhelmed by the girl and her young pliant warmth. nl     when she had firmly returned him to his group, he remembered, by a connection quite untraceable, that his mother's mother had been scotch, and with head thrown back, eyes closed, wide mouth indicating ecstasy, he sang, very slowly and richly, ""loch lomond."" nl     but that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship. the man from sparta said he was a ""bum singer,"" and for ten minutes babbitt quarreled with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. they called for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. all the while babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. when w. a. rogers drawled, ""what say we go down the line and look over the girls?"" he agreed savagely. before they went, three of them secretly made appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed ""yes, yes, sure, darling"" to everything they said, and amiably forgot them. nl     as they drove back through the outskirts of monarch, down streets of small brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they rattled across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast and perilous, as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic pianos and the stocky women who simpered, babbitt was frightened. he wanted to leap from the taxicab, but all his body was a murky fire, and he groaned, ""too late to quit now,"" and knew that he did not want to quit. nl     there was, they felt, one very humorous incident on the way. a broker from minnemagantic said, ""monarch is a lot sportier than zenith. you zenith tightwads haven't got any joints like these here."" babbitt raged, ""that's a dirty lie! snothin' you can't find in zenith. believe me, we got more houses and hootch-parlors an' all kinds o' dives than any burg in the state."" nl     he realized they were laughing at him; he desired to fight; and forgot it in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since college. nl     in the morning, when he returned to zenith, his desire for rebellion was partly satisfied. he had retrograded to a shamefaced contentment. he was irritable. he did not smile when w. a. rogers complained, ""ow, what a head! i certainly do feel like the wrath of god this morning. say! i know what was the trouble! somebody went and put alcohol in my booze last night."" nl     babbitt's excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in zenith save rogers and wing. it was not officially recognized even by himself. if it had any consequences, they have not been discovered."

16,Sencha,Power,"introductory note nl the vast and interesting epic literature of ireland has remained, for the most part, inaccessible to english readers until these last sixty years. in 1853, nicholas o'kearney published the irish text and an english translation of ""the battle of gabra,"" and since that date the volume of printed texts and english versions has steadily increased. now there lies open to the ordinary reader a considerable mass of material illustrating the imaginative life of medieval ireland. nl of these irish epic tales, ""the destruction of dá derga's hostel"" is a specimen of remarkable beauty and power. the primitive aspects of the story are made evident in the way that the plot turns upon the disasters that follow on the violation of taboos, by the monstrous nature of many of the warriors, and by the absence of any attempt to explain the beliefs implied or the marvels related in it. the powers and achievements of the heroes are fantastic and extraordinary beyond description. the natural and extra-natural constantly mingle, yet nowhere does the narrator express surprise. the technical method of the tale, too, is curiously and almost mechanically symmetrical, after the manner of savage art. both description and narration are marked by a high degree of freshness and vividness. nl the following translation is, with slight modification, that of dr. whitley stokes, from a text constructed by him on the basis of eight manuscripts, the oldest going back to about 1100 a.d. the story itself is, without doubt, from several centuries earlier and belongs to the oldest group of extant irish sagas. nl the destruction nl of dá derga's hostel nl there was a famous and noble king over erin, named eochaid feidlech. once upon a time he came over the fairgreen of bri leith, and he saw at the edge of a well a woman with a bright comb of silver adorned with gold, washing in a silver basin wherein were four golden birds and little, bright gems of purple carbuncle in the rims of the basin. a mantle she had, curly and purple, a beautiful cloak, and in the mantle silvery fringes arranged, and a brooch of fairest gold. a kirtle she wore, long, hooded, hard-smooth, of green silk, with red embroidery of gold. marvellous clasps of gold and silver in the kirtle on her breasts and her shoulders and spaulds on every side. the sun kept shining upon her, so that the glistening of the gold against the sun from the green silk was manifest to men. on her head were two golden-yellow tresses, in each of which was a plait of four locks, with a bead at the point of each lock. the hue of that hair seemed to them like the flower of the iris in summer, or like red gold after the burnishing thereof. nl there she was, undoing her hair to wash it, with her arms out through the sleeve-holes of her smock. white as the snow of one night were the two hands, soft and even, and red as foxglove were the two clear-beautiful cheeks. dark as the back of a stag-beetle the two eyebrows. like a shower of pearls were the teeth in her head. blue as a hyacinth were the eyes. red as rowan-berries the lips. very high, smooth and soft-white the shoulders. clear-white and lengthy the fingers. long were the hands. white as the foam of a wave was the flank, slender, long, tender, smooth, soft as wool. polished and warm, sleek and white were the two thighs. round and small, hard and white the two knees. short and white and rulestraight the two shins. justly straight and beautiful the two heels. if a measure were put on the feet it would hardly have found them unequal, unless the flesh of the coverings should grow upon them. the bright radiance of the moon was in her noble face: the loftiness of pride in her smooth eyebrows: the light of wooing in each of her regal eyes. a dimple of delight in each of her cheeks, with a dappling (?) in them, at one time, of purple spots with redness of a calf's blood, and at another with the bright lustre of snow. soft womanly dignity in her voice; a step steady and slow she had: a queenly gait was hers. verily, of the world's women 'twas she was the dearest and loveliest and justest that the eyes of men had ever beheld. it seemed to king eochaid and his followers that she was from the elfmounds. of her was said: ""shapely are all till compared with etáin,"" ""dear are all till compared with etáin."" nl a longing for her straightway seized the king; so he sent forward a man of his people to detain her. the king asked tidings of her and said, while announcing himself: ""shall i have an hour of dalliance with thee?"" nl ""'tis for that we have come hither under thy safeguard,"" quoth she. nl ""query, whence art thou and whence hast thou come?"" says eochaid. nl ""easy to say,"" quoth she. ""etáin am i, daughter of etar, king of the cavalcade from the elfmounds. i have been here for twenty years since i was born in an elfmound. the men of the elfmound, both kings and nobles, have been wooing me: but nought was gotten from me, because ever since i was able to speak, i have loved thee and given thee a child's love for the high tales about thee and thy splendour. and though i had never seen thee, i knew thee at once from thy description: it is thou, then, i have reached."" nl ""no 'seeking of an ill friend afar' shall be thine,"" says eochaid. ""thou shalt have welcome, and for thee every other woman shall be left by me, and with thee alone will i live so long as thou hast honour."" nl ""my proper bride-price to me!"" she says, ""and afterwards my desire."" nl ""thou shalt have both,"" says eochaid. nl seven cumals are given to her. nl  nl then the king, even eochaid feidlech, dies, leaving one daughter named, like her mother, etáin, and wedded to cormac, king of ulaid. nl after the end of a time cormac, king of ulaid, ""the man of the three gifts,"" forsakes eochaid's daughter, because she was barren save for one daughter that she had borne to cormac after the making of the pottage which her mother--the woman from the elfmounds--gave her. then she said to her mother: ""bad is what thou hast given me: it will be a daughter that i shall bear."" nl ""that will not be good,"" says her mother; ""a king's pursuit will be on her."" nl then cormac weds again his wife, even etáin, and this was his desire, that the daughter of the woman who had before been abandoned  should be killed. so cormac would not leave the girl to her mother to be nursed. then his two thralls take her to a pit, and she smiles a laughing smile at them as they were putting her into it. then their kindly nature came to them. they carry her into the calfshed of the cowherds of etirscél, great-grandson of iar, king of tara, and they fostered her till she became a good embroideress; and there was not in ireland a king's daughter dearer than she. nl a fenced house of wickerwork was made by the thralls for her, without any door, but only a window and a skylight. king etercél's folk espy that house and suppose that it was food the cowherds kept there. but one of them went and looked through the skylight, and he saw in the house the dearest, beautifullest maiden! this is told to the king, and straightway he sends his people to break the house and carry her off without asking the cowherds. for the king was childless, and it had been prophesied to him by his wizards that a woman of unknown race would bear him a son. nl then said the king: ""this is the woman that has been prophesied to me!"" nl now while she was there next morning she saw a bird on the skylight coming to her, and he leaves his birdskin on the floor of the house, and went to her, and possessed her, and said: ""they are coming to thee from the king to wreck thy house and to bring thee to him perforce. and thou wilt be pregnant by me, and bear a son, and that son must not kill birds. and 'conaire, son of mess buachalla' shall be his name,"" for hers was mess buachalla, ""the cowherds' fosterchild."" nl  nl and then she was brought to the king, and with her went her fosterers, and she was betrothed to the king, and he gave her seven cumals and to her fosterers seven other cumals. and afterwards they were made chieftains, so that they all became legitimate, whence are the two fedlimthi rechtaidi. and then she bore a son to the king, even conaire son of mess buachalla, and these were her three urgent prayers to the king, to wit, the nursing of her son among three households, that is, the fosterers who had nurtured her, and the two honeyworded mainès, and she herself is the third; and she said that such of the men of erin as should wish to do aught for this boy should give to those three households for the boy's protection. nl so in that wise he was reared, and the men of erin straightway knew this boy on the day he was born. and other boys were fostered with him, to wit, fer le and fer gar and fer rogein, three great-grandsons of donn désa the champion, an army-man of the army from muc-lesi. nl now conaire possessed three gifts, to wit, the gift of hearing and the gift of eyesight and the gift of judgment; and of those three gifts he taught one to each of his three foster-brothers. and whatever meal was prepared for him, the four of them would go to it. even though three meals were prepared for him each of them would go to his meal. the same raiment and armour and colour of horses had the four. nl then the king, even eterscéle, died. a bull-feast is gathered by the men of erin, in order to determine their future king; that is, a bull used to be killed by them and thereof one man would eat his fill and drink its broth, and a spell of truth was chanted over him in his bed. whosoever he would see in his sleep would be king, and the sleeper would perish if he uttered a falsehood. nl four men in chariots were on the plain of liffey at their game, conaire himself and his three foster-brothers. then his fosterers went to him that he might repair to the bullfeast. the bull-feaster, then in his sleep, at the end of the night beheld a man stark-naked, passing along the road of tara, with a stone in his sling. nl ""i will go in the morning after you,"" quoth he. nl he left his foster-brothers at their game, and turned his chariot and his charioteer until he was in dublin. there he saw great, white-speckled birds, of unusual size and colour and beauty. he pursues them until his horses were tired. the birds would go a spearcast before him, and would not go any further. he alighted, and takes his sling for them out of the chariot. he goes after them until he was at the sea. the birds betake themselves to the wave. he went to them and overcame them. the birds quit their birdskins, and turn upon him with spears and swords. one of them protects him, and addressed him, saying: ""i am némglan, king of thy father's birds; and thou hast been forbidden to cast at birds, for here there is no one that should not be dear to thee because of his father or mother."" nl ""till today,"" says conaire, ""i knew not this."" nl ""go to tara tonight,"" says némglan; ""'tis fittest for thee. a bull feast is there, and through it thou shalt be king. a man stark-naked, who shall go at the end of the night along one of the roads of tara, having a stone and a sling--'tis he that shall be king."" nl so in this wise conaire fared forth; and on each of the four roads whereby men go to tara there were three kings awaiting him, and they had raiment for him, since it had been foretold that he would come stark-naked. then he was seen from the road on which his fosterers were, and they put royal raiment about him, and placed him in a chariot, and he bound his pledges. nl the folk of tara said to him: ""it seems to us that our bullfeast and our spell of truth are a failure, if it be only a young, beardless lad that we have visioned therein."" nl ""that is of no moment,"" quoth he. ""for a young, generous king like me to be in the kingship is no disgrace, since the binding of tara's pledges is mine by right of father and grandsire."" nl ""excellent! excellent!"" says the host. they set the kingship of erin upon him. and he said: ""i will enquire of wise men that i myself may be wise."" nl then he uttered all this as he had been taught by the man at the wave, who said this to him: ""thy reign will be subject to a restriction, but the bird-reign will be noble, and this shall be thy restriction, i. e. thy tabu. nl ""thou shalt not go righthandwise round tara and lefthandwise round bregia. nl ""the evil-beasts of cerna must not be hunted by thee. nl ""and thou shalt not go out every ninth night beyond tara. nl ""thou shalt not sleep in a house from which firelight is manifest outside, after sunset, and in which light is manifest from without. nl ""and three reds shall not go before thee to red's house. nl ""and no rapine shall be wrought in thy reign. nl ""and after sunset a company of one woman or one man shall not enter the house in which thou art. nl ""and thou shalt not settle the quarrel of thy two thralls. nl now there were in his reign great bounties, to wit, seven ships in every june in every year arriving at inver colptha, and oakmast up to the knees in every autumn, and plenty of fish in the rivers bush and boyne in the june of each year, and such abundance of good will that no one slew another in erin during his reign. and to every one in erin his fellow's voice seemed as sweet as the strings of lutes. from mid-spring to mid-autumn no wind disturbed a cow's tail. his reign was neither thunderous nor stormy. nl  nl now his foster-brothers murmured at the taking from them of their father's and their grandsire's gifts, namely theft and robbery and slaughter of men and rapine. they thieved the three thefts from the same man, to wit, a swine and an ox and a cow, every year, that they might see what punishment therefor the king would inflict upon them, and what damage the theft in his reign would cause to the king. nl now every year the farmer would come to the king to complain, and the king would say to him. ""go thou and address donn désá's three great grandsons, for 'tis they that have taken the beasts."" whenever he went to speak to donn désá's descendants they would almost kill him, and he would not return to the king lest conaire should attend his hurt. nl since, then, pride and wilfulness possessed them, they took to marauding, surrounded by the sons of the lords of the men of erin. thrice fifty men had they as pupils when they (the pupils) were were-wolfing in the province of connaught, until maine milscothach's swineherd saw them, and he had never seen that before. he went in flight. when they heard him they pursued him. the swineherd shouted, and the people of the two mainès came to him, and the thrice fifty men were arrested, along with their auxiliaries, and taken to tara. they consulted the king concerning the matter, and he said: ""let each (father) slay his son, but let my fosterlings be spared."" nl ""leave, leave!"" says every one: ""it shall be done for thee."" nl ""nay indeed,"" quoth he; ""no 'cast of life' by me is the doom i have delivered. the men shall not be hung; but let veterans go with them that they may wreak their rapine on the men of alba."" nl this they do. thence they put to sea and met the son of the king of britain, even ingcél the one-eyed, grandson of conmac: thrice fifty men and their veterans they met upon the sea. nl they make an alliance, and go with ingcél and wrought rapine with him. nl this is the destruction which his own impulse gave him. that was the night that his mother and his father and his seven brothers had been bidden to the house of the king of his district. all of them were destroyed by ingcél in a single night. then the irish pirates put out to sea to the land of erin to seek a destruction as payment for that to which ingcél had been entitled from them. nl in conaire's reign there was perfect peace in erin, save that in thomond there was a joining of battle between the two carbres. two foster-brothers of his were they. and until conaire came it was impossible to make peace between them. 'twas a tabu of his to go to separate them before they had repaired to him. he went, however, although to do so was one of his tabus, and he made peace between them. he remained five nights with each of the two. that also was a tabu of his. nl after settling the two quarrels, he was travelling to tara. this is the way they took to tara, past usnech of meath; and they saw the raiding from east and west, and from south and north, and they saw the warbands and the hosts, and the men stark-naked; and the land of the southern o'neills was a cloud of fire around him. nl ""what is this?"" asked conaire. ""easy to say,"" his people answer. ""easy to know that the king's law has broken down therein, since the country has begun to burn."" nl ""whither shall we betake ourselves?"" says conaire. nl ""to the northeast,"" says his people. nl so then they went righthandwise round tara, and lefthandwise round bregia, and the evil beasts of cerna were hunted by him. but he saw it not till the chase had ended. nl they that made of the world that smoky mist of magic were elves, and they did so because conaire's tabus had been violated. nl great fear then fell on conaire because they had no way to wend save upon the road of midluachair and the road of cuálu. nl so they took their way by the coast of ireland southward. nl then said conaire on the road of cuálu: ""whither shall we go tonight?"" nl ""may i succeed in telling thee! my fosterling conaire,"" says mac cecht, son of snade teiched, the champion of conaire, son of eterscél. ""oftener have the men of erin been contending for thee every night than thou hast been wandering about for a guesthouse."" nl ""judgment goes with good times,"" says conaire. ""i had a friend in this country, if only we knew the way to his house!"" nl ""what is his name?"" asked mac cecht. nl ""dá derga of leinster,"" answered conaire. ""he came unto me to seek a gift from me, and he did not come with a refusal. i gave him a hundred kine of the drove. i gave him a hundred fatted swine. i gave him a hundred mantles made of close cloth. i gave him a hundred blue-coloured weapons of battle. i gave him ten red, gilded brooches. i gave him ten vats good and brown. i gave him ten thralls. i gave him ten querns. i gave him thrice nine hounds all-white in their silvern chains. i gave him a hundred race-horses in the herds of deer. there would be no abatement in his case though he should come again. he would make return. it is strange if he is surly to me tonight when reaching his abode."" nl ""when i was acquainted with his house,"" says mac cecht, ""the road whereon thou art going towards him was the boundary of his abode. it continues till it enters his house, for through the house passes the road. there are seven doorways into the house, and seven bedrooms between every two doorways; but there is only one doorvalve on it, and that valve is turned to every doorway to which the wind blows."" nl ""with all that thou hast here,"" says conaire, ""thou shalt go in thy great multitude until thou alight in the midst of the house."" nl ""if so be,"" answers mac cecht, ""that thou goest thither, i go on that i may strike fire there ahead of thee."" nl when conaire after this was journeying along the road of cuálu, he marked before him three horsemen riding towards the house. three red frocks had they, and three red mantles: three red bucklers they bore, and three red spears were in their hands: three red steeds they bestrode, and three red heads of hair were on them. red were they all, both body and hair and raiment, both steeds and men. nl ""who is it that fares before us?"" asked conaire. ""it was a tabu of mine for those three to go before me--the three reds to the house of red. who will follow them and tell them to come towards me in my track?"" nl ""i will follow them,"" says lé fri flaith, conaire's son. nl he goes after them, lashing his horse, and overtook them not. there was the length of a spearcast between them: but they did not gain upon him and he did not gain upon them. nl he told them not to go before the king. he overtook them not; but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder: nl ""lo, my son, great the news, news from a hostel . . . lo, my son!"" nl they go away from him then: he could not detain them. nl the boy waited for the host. he told his father what was said to him. conaire liked it not. ""after them, thou!"" says conaire, ""and offer them three oxen and three bacon-pigs, and so long as they shall be in my household, no one shall be among them from fire to wall."" nl so the lad goes after them, and offers them that, and overtook them not. but one of the three men sang a lay to him over his shoulder: nl ""lo, my son, great the news! a generous king's great ardour whets thee, burns thee. through ancient men's enchantments a company of nine yields. lo, my son!"" nl the boy turns back and repeated the lay to conaire. nl ""go after them,"" says conaire, ""and offer them six oxen and six bacon pigs, and my leavings, and gifts tomorrow, and so long as they shall be in my household no one to be among them from fire to wall."" nl the lad then went after them, and overtook them not; but one of the three men answered and said: nl ""lo, my son, great the news. weary are the steeds we ride. we ride the steeds of donn tetscorach from the elfmounds. though we are alive we are dead. great are the signs: destruction of life: sating of ravens: feeding of crows, strife of slaughter: wetting of sword-edge, shields with broken bosses in hours after sundown. lo, my son!"" nl then they go from him. nl ""i see that thou hast not detained the men,"" says conaire. nl ""indeed it is not i that betrayed it,"" says lé fri flaith. nl he recited the last answer that they gave him. conaire and his retainers were not blithe thereat: and afterwards evil forebodings of terror were on them. nl ""all my tabus have seized me tonight,"" says conaire, ""since those three reds are the banished folks."" nl  nl they went forward to the house and took their seats therein, and fastened their red steeds to the door of the house. nl that is the forefaring of the three reds in the bruden dá derga. nl this is the way that conaire took with his troops, to dublin. nl  nl conaire and his troops to dublin nl 'tis then the man of the black, cropt hair, with his one hand and one eye and one foot, overtook them. rough cropt hair upon him. though a sackful of wild apples were flung on his crown, not an apple would fall on the ground, but each of them would stick on his hair. though his snout were flung on a branch they would remain together. long and thick as an outer yoke was each of his two shins. each of his buttocks was the size of a cheese on a withe. a forked pole of iron black-pointed was in his hand. a swine, black-bristled, singed, was on his back, squealing continually, and a woman big-mouthed, huge, dark, sorry, hideous, was behind him. though her snout were flung on a branch, the branch would support it. her lower lip would reach her knee. nl he starts forward to meet conaire, and made him welcome. ""welcome to thee, o master conaire! long hath thy coming hither been known."" nl ""who gives the welcome?"" asks conaire. nl ""fer caille here, with his black swine for thee to consume that thou be not fasting tonight, for 'tis thou art the best king that has come into the world!"" nl ""what is thy wife's name?"" says conaire. nl ""cichuil,"" he answers. nl ""any other night,"" says conaire, ""that pleases you, i will come to you,--and leave us alone tonight."" nl ""nay,"" say the churl, ""for we will go to thee to the place wherein thou wilt be tonight, o fair little master conaire!"" nl so he goes towards the house, with his great, big-mouthed wife behind him, and his swine short-bristled, black, singed, squealing continually, on his back. that was one of conaire's tabus, and that plunder should be taken in ireland during his reign was another tabu of his. nl now plunder was taken by the sons of donn désa, and five hundred there were in the body of their marauders, besides what underlings were with them. this, too, was a tabu of conaire's. there was a good warrior in the north country, ""wain over withered sticks,"" this was his name. why he was so called was because he used to go over his opponent even as a wain would go over withered sticks. now plunder was taken by him, and there were five hundred in the body of their marauders alone, besides underlings. nl there was after that a troop of still haughtier heroes, namely, the seven sons of ailill and medb, each of whom was called ""manè."" and each manè had a nickname, to wit, manè fatherlike and manè motherlike, and manè gentle-pious, manè very-pious, manè unslow, and manè honeyworded, manè grasp-them-all, and manè the loquacious. rapine was wrought by them. as to manè motherlike and manè unslow there were fourteen score in the body of their marauders. manè fatherlike had three hundred and fifty. manè honeyworded had five hundred. manè grasp-them-all had seven hundred. manè the loquacious had seven hundred. each of the others had five hundred in the body of his marauders. nl there was a valiant trio of the men of cúalu of leinster, namely, the three red hounds of cualu, called cethach and clothach and conall. now rapine was wrought by them, and twelve score were in the body of their marauders, and they had a troop of madmen. in conaire's reign a third of the men of ireland were reavers. he was of sufficient strength and power to drive them out of the land of erin so as to transfer their marauding to the other side (great britain), but after this transfer they returned to their country. nl when they had reached the shoulder of the sea, they meet ingcél the one eyed and eiccel and tulchinne, three great-grandsons of conmac of britain, on the raging of the sea. a man ungentle, huge, fearful, uncouth was ingcél. a single eye in his head, as broad as an oxhide, as black as a chafer, with three pupils therein. thirteen hundred were in the body of his marauders. the marauders of the men of erin were more numerous than they. nl they go for a sea-encounter on the main. ""ye should not do this,"" says ingcél: ""do not break the truth of men (fair play) upon us, for ye are more in number than i."" nl ""nought but a combat on equal terms shall befall thee,"" say the reavers of erin. nl ""there is somewhat better for you,"" quoth ingcél. ""let us make peace since ye have been cast out of the land of erin, and we have been cast out of the land of alba and britain. let us make an agreement between us. come ye and wreak your rapine in my country, and i will go with you and wreak my rapine in your country."" nl they follow this counsel, and they gave pledges therefor from this side and from that. there are the sureties that were given to ingcél by the men of erin, namely, fer gair and gabur (or fer lee) and fer rogain, for the destruction that ingcél should choose to cause in ireland and for the destruction that the sons of donn désa should choose in alba and britain. nl a lot was cast upon them to see with which of them they should go first. it fell that they should go with ingcél to his country. so they made for britain, and there his father and mother and his seven brothers were slain, as we have said before. thereafter they made for alba, and there they wrought the destruction, and then they returned to erin. nl 'tis then, now, that conaire son of eterscél went towards the hostel along the road of cualu. nl 'tis then that the reavers came till they were in the sea off the coast of bregia overagainst howth. nl then said the reavers: ""strike the sails, and make one band of you on the sea that ye may not be sighted from land; and let some lightfoot be found from among you to go on shore to see if we could save our honors with ingcél. a destruction for the destruction he has given us."" nl ""who will go on shore to listen? let some one ago,"" says ingcél, ""who should have there the three gifts, namely, gift of hearing, gift of far sight, and gift of judgment."" nl ""i,"" says manè honeyworded, ""have the gift of hearing."" nl ""and i,"" says manè unslow, ""have the gift of far sight and of judgment."" nl ""'tis well for you to go thus,"" say the reavers: ""good is that wise."" nl then nine men go on till they were on the hill of howth, to know what they might hear and see. nl ""be still a while!"" says manè honeyworded. nl ""what is that?"" asks manè unslow. nl ""the sound of a good king's cavalcade i hear."" nl ""by the gift of far sight, i see,"" quoth his comrade. nl ""what seest thou here?"" nl ""i see there,"" quoth he, ""cavalcades splendid, lofty, beautiful, warlike, foreign, somewhat slender, weary, active, keen, whetted, vehement, a good course that shakes a great covering of land. they fare to many heights, with wondrous waters and invers."" nl  nl ""what are the waters and heights and invers that they traverse?"" nl ""easy to say: indéoin, cult, cuiltén, máfat, ammat, iarmáfat, finne, goiste, guistíne. gray spears over chariots: ivory-hilted swords on thighs: silvery shields above their elbows. half red and half white. garments of every color about them. nl ""thereafter i see before them special cattle specially keen, to wit, thrice fifty dark-gray steeds. small-headed are they, red-nosed, pointed, broad-hoofed, big-nosed, red-chested, fat, easily-stopt, easily-yoked, foray-nimble, keen, whetted, vehement, with their thrice fifty bridles of red enamel upon them."" nl ""i swear by what my tribe swears,"" says the man of the long sight, ""these are the cattle of some good lord. this is my judgment thereof: it is conaire, son of eterscél, with multitudes of the men of erin around him, who has travelled the road."" nl back then they go that they may tell it to the reavers.

nl the woman seized it by the tail, and dragged it out of the wound, and it takes the full of its jaws out of him. nl ""truly,"" says the woman, ""this is 'an ant of ancient land.'"" nl says mac cecht ""i swear to god what my people swears, i deemed it no bigger than a fly, or a gnat, or an ant."" nl and mac cecht took the wolf by the throat, and struck it a blow on the forehead, and killed it with a single blow. nl then lé fri flaith, son of conaire, died under mac cecht's armpit, for the warrior's heat and sweat had dissolved him. nl thereafter mac cecht, having cleansed the slaughter, at the end of the third day, set forth, and he dragged conaire with him on his back, and buried him at tara, as some say. then mac cecht departed into connaught, to his own country, that he might work his cure in mag bréngair. wherefore the name clave to the plain from mac cecht's misery, that is, mag brén-guir. nl now conall cernach escaped from the hostel, and thrice fifty spears had gone through the arm which upheld his shield. he fared forth till he reached his father's house, with half his shield in his hand, and his sword, and the fragments of his two spears. then he found his father before his garth in taltiu. nl ""swift are the wolves that have hunted thee, my son,"" saith his father. nl ""'tis this that has wounded us, thou old hero, an evil conflict with warriors,"" conall cernach replied. nl ""hast thou then news of dá derga's hostel?"" asked amorgin. ""is thy lord alive?"" nl ""he is not alive,"" says conall. nl ""i swear to god what the great tribes of ulaid swear, it is cowardly for the man who went thereout alive, having left his lord with his foes in death."" nl ""my wounds are not white, thou old hero,"" says conall. nl he shews him his shield-arm, whereon were thrice fifty wounds: this is what was inflicted upon it. the shield that guarded it is what saved it. but the right arm had been played upon, as far as two thirds thereof, since the shield had not been guarding it. that arm was mangled and maimed and wounded and pierced, save that the sinews kept it to the body without separation. nl ""that arm fought tonight, may son,"" says amorgein. nl ""true is that, thou old hero,"" says conall cernach. ""many there are unto whom it gave drinks of death tonight in front of the hostel."" nl now as to the reavers, every one of them that escaped from the hostel went to the cairn which they had built on the night before last, and they brought thereout a stone for each man not mortally wounded. so this is what they lost by death at the hostel, a man for every stone that is (now) in carn lecca. nl  nl it endeth: amen: it endeth"

20,less.people,Laid Up,"the following transcript is adapted from an interview that took place in the visitor’s lounge at the st. tekawitha retirement community in spokane, washington, on february 28, 2052: nl q: hello, i’m going to record this, that is, if that’s okay with you? is that okay? nl a: yes. nl q: good, good. so, would you, could we begin, could you please begin by stating your name, your birth date, your age, where you were born, and that’s it. nl a: you first. nl q: excuse me? nl a: you should tell me who you are first. that’s the polite way. nl q: oh, okay, i suppose you’re correct. i’m spencer cox, born july 7, 2007, in old los angeles. i’m forty-five years old. okay? is that okay? nl a: yes, that’s good. it’s nice to meet you. nl q: yes, it’s my pleasure. nl (ten seconds of silence) nl q: and? nl a: and? nl q: would you like to introduce yourself? nl a: yes. nl (fifteen words of silence) nl q: well, possibly you could do it now? if you please? nl a: my name is etta joseph. i was born in wellpinit, washington, on the spokane indian reservation on christmas day, 1934. i am one hundred and eighteen years old and i am the last of the spokane indians. nl q: really? i had no idea you were the last. nl a: well, actually, i’m not. there are thousands of us. but it sounds more romantic, enit? nl q: yes, very amusing. irony, a hallmark of the contemporary indigenous american. good, good. yes. so, perhaps we could officially begin by… nl a: spencer, what exactly is it you do? nl q: i’m a cultural anthropologist. an anthropologist is … nl a: i know what an anthropologist is. nl q: yes, yes, of course you do. as i was saying, i am a cultural anthropologist and the owens lecturer in applied indigenous studies at harvard university. i’m also the author of seventeen books, texts, focusing on mid- to late-twentieth-century native american culture, most specifically the interior salish tribes of washington state. nl ( twenty seconds of silence) nl q: so, miss joseph, can i call you etta? nl a: no. nl q: oh, i see, okay. formality. yes, quite another hallmark of the indigenous. ceremony and all. i understand. i’m honored to be included. so, miss joseph, perhaps we could begin, i mean, could i ask an introductory question? yes. well, let’s see, you have been a traditional powwow dancer for the last eighty years, in that time, how has the powwow changed? of course, the contemporary powwow is not a sacred ceremony, not as we have come to understand it, but rather a series of pan-indian ceremonies whose influences include many tribal cultures and popular american culture as well, but i was wondering how you … nl a: why are you really here? nl q: well, i was trying to get into that. i wanted to talk about dance and the indian… nl a: you’re here about john wayne, enit? nl q: excuse me? nl a: you came here to talk about john wayne. nl q: well, no, but the john wayne mythology certainly plays an important role in the shaping of twentieth-century american and native american culture, but… nl a: have you ever seen a john wayne movie? nl q: yes, yes, i have. most of them, in fact. i was quite the little cowboy when i was a child. had two red ryder six-shooter pistols. they shot these little silver pellets. i recall that i killed a squirrel. i was quite shocked. i had no idea the pellets were dangerous, but i suppose that’s beside the point. now, back to dance… nl a: i used to be an actress. nl q: really? well, let’s see here, i don’t recall reading about that in your file. nl a: what are you doing? nl q: well, i’m reading through your file, your profile here, the pre-interview, some excellent books regarding your tribe, and a few texts transcribed directly from the spokane tribe oral tradition, which i must say, are quite.. nl a:  just pout those papers away. and those books. what is it with you white people and your books? nl q: i’m afraid i don’t understand. nl a: how come you love books so much? nl q: as my mother used to say, they’re the keys to the locked doors of the house of wisdom. nl a: did your mother really say that? nl q: well, no. nl a: so, then, it’s a lie? you jut told me a lie? nl q: yes, yes, i suppose i did. nl a: it’s a good lie. charming even. attributing one of yout faintly amusing and fairly poetic lines to your own mother. you must love her quite a bit. nl q: oh. well, i don’t know how to respond to that. nl a: are you a liar? nl q: what do you mean? nl a: do you tell lies? nl q: everybody tells lies. i mean, occasionally. nl a: that’s not what i asked you. nl q: yes, i tell lies. but i hardly think of myself as a liar. nl (twenty-seven seconds of silence) nl q: okay, so perhaps i am a liar, but not all the time. nl (twenty-two seconds of silence) nl q: why exactly are you calling me a liar? nl a: i haven’t called you anything. nl q: but you accused me of lying. nl a: no, i asked you if you were lying and you said yes. so i think that means you accused yourself of being a liar. good observation, by the way. nl q: what’s the point of all this? nl a: i’m having fun with you. nl q: well, if you’re not going to take this seriously, i’m afraid i might have to move on. my time is valuable. nl a: having fun is very serious. nl q: i hardly think a few jokes are serious. i am currently working on a serious and profound study on the effect of classical european ballroom dancing on the indigenous powwow—a revolutionary text, by the way—so i don’t have time for a lonely woman’s jests and insults. nl a: you have a lot to learn. you should listen more and talk less. nl q: pardon me. i think i’ll leave now. nl a: i’m no lonely. have a good day. nl (ten seconds of silence) nl q: okay, wait, i think i understand. we were participating in a tribal dialogue, weren’t we? that sort of confrontational banter which solidifies familial and tribal ties, weren’t we? oh, how fascinating, and i failed to recognize it. nl a: what re you talking about? nl q: well, confrontational banter has always been a cultural mainstay of indigenous cultures. in its african form, it becomes the tribal rite they call “doing the dozens.” you know, momma jokes? like, your mother is so fat, when she broke her leg gravy poured out. it’s all part of the oral tradition. and here i was being insulted by you, and i didn’t recognize it as an integral and quite lovely component of the oral tradition. of course you had to insult me. it’s your tradition. nl a: oh, stop it, just stop it. don’t give me that oral tradition garbage. it’s so primitive. it makes it sound like indians sit around naked and grunt stories at each other. those books about indians, those texts you love so much, where do you think they come from? nl q: well, certainly, all written language has its roots in the oral tradition, but i fail… nl a: no, no, no, those books started with somebody’s lie. then some more lies were piled on top of that, until you had a whole book filled with lies, and then somebody slapped an edward curtis photograph on the cover, and called it good. nl q: these books of lies, as you call them, are the definitive texts on the interior salish. nl a: no, there’s nothing definitive about them. they’re just your oral tradition. and they’re filled with the same lies, exaggerations, mistakes, and ignorance as our oral traditions. nl q: have you ever read these books? nl a: i’ve read all of your books. you show me a book written by a white man about indians and i’ve read it. you show me almost any book, any of your so-called great books, and i’ve read them. hemingway, faulkner, conrad. read them all. austen, kafka, james, read them. whitman, dickinson, donne. read them. we head over to this university or that college, to your harvard, and grab their list of required reads, and i’ve read them. hundreds of your books, your white-man books, thousands of them. i’ve read them all. nl q: and what is your point in telling me this? nl a: i know so much more about you than you will ever know about me. nl q: miss joseph, i am a leading authority, no, i am the, the, the leading authority in the field… nl a: mr. cox, spenser. for the last one hundred and eighteen years, i have lived in your world, your white world. in order to survive, to thrive, i have to be white for fifty-seven minutes of every hour. nl q: how about the other three minutes? nl a: that, sir, is when i get to be indian, and you have no idea, no concept, no possible way of knowing what happens in those three minutes. nl q: then tell me. that’s what i am here for. nl a: oh, no, no, no. those three minutes belong to us. they are very secret. you’ve colonized indian land but i am not about to let you colonize my heart and mind. nl q: tell me then. why are you here? why did you consent to this interview? what do you have to tell me that could possibly help me with me work? you, you are speaking political nonsense. colonialism. that’s the tired mantra of liberals who’ve run out of intellectual imagination. i am here to engage in a free exchange of ideas, and you’re here, you want to inject politics into this. i will have no part of it. nl a: i lost my virginity to john wayne. nl (forty-nine seconds of silence) nl q: you’re speaking metaphorically, of course. nl a: spencer, i am speaking of the vagina and the penis. nl q: as metaphors? nl a: do you know the movie the searchers? nl q: the western? directed by john ford? yes, yes, quite well, actually. released in 1956, i believe. nl a: 1952. nl q: no, no, i’m quite sure it was 1956. nl a: you’re quite sure of a lot of things and you’re quite wrong about a lot of them, too. nl (five seconds of silence) nl q: well, i do know the searchers. wayne plays ethan edwards, the ex-confederate soldier who sets out to find his niece, played by natalie wood. she’s been captured by the camanches who massacred ethan’s family. along with jeffery hunter, who plays a half-breed cherokee, of all things! wayne will not surrender to hunger, thirst, snow, heat, or loneliness in his quest, his search. a quite brilliant film. nl a: enough with that academic crap. listen to me. listen carefully. in 1952, in kayenta, arizona, while john wayne was playing ethan edwards, and i was playing a navajo extra, we fell in love. him, for the first and only time with an indian. me, for the first time with anybody. nl “my real name is marion,” said john wayne as he slid the condom over his erect penis. his hands were shaking, making it nearly impossible to him to properly fit the condom, so etta joseph reached down, smoother the rubber with the palm of her left hand—she was touching john wayne—and then guided him inside of her. he made love carefully, with an unintentional tantric rhythm: three shallow thrusts followed by one deep thrust, repeat as necessary. nl “does it hurt?” asked john wayne, with genuine concern, and not because he was arrogant about being her first lover. nl “it’s okay,” said etta, but it did hurt him. it hurt a lot. she wondered why people were so crazy about this act. but still, she was making love to john wayne. nl “oh, oh, john wayne,” she moaned. she felt uncomfortable, silly, like a bad actress in a bad love scene. nl “call me marion,” he said between thrusts. “my real name is marion. call me marion.” nl “marion, marion, marion,” she whispered. nl they laid together on a pendleton blanket on the red sand of the navajo monument valley. all around them, the impossible mesas. above them, the most stars either of them had ever seen. nl “i love you, i love you,” he said as he kissed her face, neck, breasts. his lips were thin, his face rough with three days of beard. nl “oh,” she said, surprised by his words, even frightened. how could he be in love with her? he didn’t even know her. she was just an eighteen-year-old spokane indian woman—a girl—a thousand miles away from home, from her reservation. she was not in navajo land by accident—she was an actress, after all—but she hadn’t planned on lying beneath john wayne—marion!—as he confessed his love, his impossible love for her. nl three days earlier, she’d been an extra in the navajo camp when john wayne and jeffery hunter traded blankets, hates, and secrets with the navajo chief. etta hadn’t had any lines. she’d only been set dressing, a pretty girl in a purple dress. but she’d been proud and she was sure to be on camera because john ford told her so. nl “girl,” ford had said, “you are as pretty as the mesa.” nl for just a moment, etta had wondered if ford might cast her then and there for a speaking role, perhaps even give her the role of look, the chubby daughter of the navajo chief, and send the other indian women packing. of course not! but etta had wished for it, however briefly, and had chided herself for her ambition. she’d wished ill will on another indian woman just because a white man had called her pretty. desperate and shallow, of course, but etta had not been able to help herself. nl this was john ford! he was not handsome, no, but he was a hollywood director. he made dreams come true. he was the one who filled the movie screens with the movies! he was a magician! he was a feature film director and she knew they were the kindest and most decent men in the world. nl “stand here,” ford had directed etta. “right here, so the audience can see your lovely face in the background here. right between jeffrey and the duke.” she had not been able to contain her excitement. five feet, away, john wayne was smoking a cigarette. john wayne! but more than that, it had been jeffery hunter who’d captured her imagination. he was a beautiful boy, with dark hair, brown skin, and those blue, blue eyes. john wayne might have been a movie star—and a relatively homely one at that—but jeffery hunter was simply the most gorgeous white man on the planet. but here he was playing an indian, a half-breed cherokee, so perhaps jeffery himself was part indian. after all, etta had thought, why would they cast a white man as an indian if he didn’t have some indian blood himself? otherwise, the movie would have been a lie, and john wayne didn’t lie. and judging by the kindness in his eyes, by the graceful turn oh his spine, by the way he waved his sensuous hands when he talked, jeffery hunter was no liar either. nl anyway, they’d filmed the scene, a funny one where jeffery hunter had inadvertently traded a hat for a navajo wife, for look—how positively amusing!—and all the while, etta had looked on and wished that jeffery hunter had traded for her. not jeffery hunter the actor in the scene, but jeffery hunter the blue-eyed man. nl “mr. hunter, you were wonderful,” she’d said when she’d approached him after the scene. nl without a word to her, he’d turn and walked away. she’d admired his silence, his commitment to his craft. he hadn’t wanted to be distracted by the shallow attentions of some indian girl other than look. still. her feelings had been hurt and there might have been a tear in her eye when john wayne sidled up close to her—yes, sidled—and shook his head. nl “i don’t understand actors,” the duke had said. “it’s the audience that matters, and yet, so often, we shun them.” nl “what does shun mean?” she asked. nl “exactly. i mean, how can we, as actors, get close to the soul, to our hearts, if we don’t look deeply into the soul and hearts of others? in the end, how can wee fragile human beings possibly by sympathetic actors if we don’t refuse to show sympathy for other people’s emotions? how can we realistically project love, hope, and faith if we are not loving, hopeful, and faithful ourselves?” nl “that’s beautiful.” nl “yes, yes. if we don’t feel it in here, in our chest, then the audience will never feel it in their hearts.” nl “that’s why i act,” she said. nl “hello, my name is john wayne.” nl “i’m etta joseph.” nl now, three days after jeffery hunter had walked away from her, etta was naked with john wayne. nl “i love you, i love you,” he whispered to her. he was gentle with her, of course, but he was strong as well. he rolled onto his back and lifted her, then lowered her down onto him. his penis was huge! it was a movie star’s penis, for sure. etta had never really thought about john wayne’s penis before. she’d never really thought abut any man’s or actor’s penis before. sure, she’d felt strong desires for men, sexual desires, but they’d always taken the form of vague shapes and sizes inside of her body. she’d never imagined what john wayne would look like naked, but there he was! strong arms, long legs, a pot belly. as he lay beneath her, as he closed his eyes, etta wondered what she should do with her hands. nobody had ever taught her how to do this, how to make love to a man. and it was john wayne, so he must have made love to a thousand different women in his life. other movie stars! he must have made love to bette davis, vivien leigh, greta garbo, grace kelly, maybe even judy garland. all those perfect women. etta felt small and terrified in the presence of john wayne. nl “what’s wrong?” he asked. nl “i’m afraid.” nl “if you get pregnant, i’ll take care of it.” nl in the rush, she’d never even thought about pregnancy. how stupid! she was only eighteen years old, unmarried, a thousand miles away from home. what would she do with a baby? and what did he mean by taking care of it? did he want to marry her, be the husband of an indian woman and the father of an indian child, or did he want her to have an abortion? god, she’d heard about abortions, how they reached inside of you with a metal hook and scraped out all of your woman parts. in terror, she rolled away from john wayne and ran naked through the desert, toward the lights of the distant set, where john ford and jeffery hunter were sure to have the answers to all of her questions. nl “wait, wait, wait,” cried john wayne as he chased after her. he was not a young man. he wondered if he could possibly catch her. but she was a child of the river and pine tree, of wild grass and mountain. she understood gravity in a different way and, therefore, tripped in the rough sands of the desert. she fell face first into the red dirt and waited for john wayne to catch and hurt her. isn’t that what he had always done? wasn’t he the man who killed indians? nl “etta, etta.” he kneeled beside her. he stroked her long black hair. she flinched and pushed him away. nl “go away, go away, john wayne,” she cried out. nl “oh, etta, i’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “i couldn’t hurt you. i love you.” nl “but you can’t love me. you don’t even know me.” nl john wayne wept. nl there, in navajo monument valley, john wayne wept. his tears fell to the sand and flooded the desert. nl “nobody knows me,” he cried. “nobody knows me.” nl he was so afraid! etta was shocked into silence. this was the great john wayne and he was afraid. nl “but, but, but,” etta stammered. “but you’re a star.” nl “john wayne is the star. i’m marion, i’m just marion morrison.” nl she held him for a good long time. nl q: i can’t believe this. are you telling me the truth> nl a: yes, as far as i can remember it. nl q: this is not a lie, one of those good lies you were talking about? nl a: spencer, i was fooling you. there’s no such thing as a good lie. nl q: bad lies, good lies, whatever. just tell me the truth. did you really lose your virginity to john wayne? nl (seven seconds of silence) nl a: he was afraid of horses, did you know that? nl q: john wayne afraid of horses? that’s completely implausible. i mean, i’d sooner believe that you slept with him. we’re talking about john wayne here. nl a: when he was seven years old, a horse kicked him in the head. he was in a coma for nearly three months. everybody through he was going to die. in the hospital, his mother brought in a catholic priest to baptize him. his father brought in a presbyterian priest for last rites. they thought he was going to die. they were sure he was going to die. nl q: i don’t recall reading any of this about john wayne. kicked in the head by a horse? that must be urban legend. nl a: he showed me the scar. just behind his right ear. about five inches long. they hid it with makeup. the horse’s name was rooster. he liked me to kiss it whenever we made love. nl q: wait, wait, wait, he liked you to kiss the horse? nl a: oh, no, no, no, silly. he liked me to kiss his scar. he said it was really sensitive, still, after all those years. he was really a sensitive man, you know? he knew how to cry. he cried every time we made love. well, this is really embarrassing, but he cried every time he had, every time, he, well, you know, had an orgasm. nl q: wait, wait, wait, what are you telling me? how many times did you make love? nl a: most every night during the filming of the movie. except for those nights when his wife and kids came to visit. nl q: so, hold on here, let me get my head around this. not only were you having sex with john wayne, you were also having an affair with him? nl a: i’m not proud of that particular nature of our relationship, but yes, john wayne was a married man. nl in navajo monument valley, during a long day of filming, john wayne stepped into the makeup trailer for a touch-up and discovered his sons happily covering their faces with lipstick and mascara. nl “well, hello there,” john wayne said to his sons. nl “they were petrified, afraid of this large man, this male. nl “are you having fun?” the duke asked his sons. nl they didn’t know how to answer. if they said no, they’d be lying, and their father always knew when they were lying. if they said yes, well, then, that could mean all sort of things, and all of them were bad. nl “are you having gun?” he asked again. his faced revealed nothing, his thin mouth was closed tight, his teeth were hidden behind that weathered face. nl the eldest son cried, so the youngest son decided to join him. nl “wait, wait, wait,” said john wayne. “what’s with all of these tears?” nl “you hate us,” cried the oldest boy. nl “don’t hate me, don’t hate me,” cried the youngest boy. john wayne scooped up his boys. he set his big cowboy hat on the youngest boy’s head. nl “i don’t hate you, i could never hate you,” said john wayne. “what makes you think i hate you?” nl “because we’re girls,” wailed the boys. nl john wayne held his sons and stroked their hair. nl “oh, there, there, you’re not girls, you’re not girls,” said the father. “what makes you think you’re girls?” nl “because we’re putting on lipstick,” said the youngest. nl john wayne laughed. nl “oh, sons, you’re just engaging in some harmless gender play. some sexual experimentation. every boy does this kind of thing. every man likes to pretend he’s a woman now and again. it’s very healthy.” nl “daddy,” said the oldest. “do you dress up like a woman?” nl “well, i don’t put on a dress or anything. but i often close my eyes and try to put myself into a woman’s shoes. i try to think like a woman. i try to embrace the feminine in myself. do you know what i mean?” nl “no,” said the boys. nl “well, sons, let me tell you the honest truth. there’s really not that much different between men and women. in all things, intelligence, passion, hope, dreams, strength, men and women are pretty much equals. i mean, gender is mostly a social construction. after all, males and females share about ninety-nine percent of the same genetic material. so, given that, how could we really be that much different? in fact, we’re all so much alike that every woman must have some masculine inside of her and every man must have feminine inside of him. you just ain’t a whole person otherwise.” nl “daddy!” shouted the boys. they were shocked. “that’s not what you said before when you were on the radio and television.” nl “boys, i know. i know. i have a public image to maintain. but that’s not who i really am. i may act like a cowboy, i might pretend to be a cowboy, but i am not a cowboy in real life, do you understand?” nl “i think so,” said the oldest son. “is it like in school, when you’re supposed to be listening to the teacher, but you’re only pretending to listen so you don’t get in trouble?” nl john wayne smiled. nl “yes, yes, it’s something like that,” he said to his sons. “now, let me teach you a little something about the birds and bees. if you want to make a woman happy, really happy, there’s only one thing you got to do.” nl “what, daddy, what?” nl “listen to her stories.” nl q: so, what happened, i mean, what did you do when his wife and sons came to visit? nl a: i felt bad, bad, bad. that john wayne, he was a good father and a good husband, too. i mean, he was cheating on them, that’s for sure, but he wasn’t going to leave them. no way. all the time he and i were together, he just kept telling me the same thing. “i ain’t leaving them,” he’d say. “i ain’t leaving them. i am a good man, and a good man ain’t a  good man without a good family.” nl q: but how do you reconcile that? how did he reconcile that? how can a man claim to love his wife and children if he’s sleeping, if he’s in love with another woman? nl a: are you married, spencer? nl q: no. nl a: kids? nl q: no. nl a: then you don’t really understand why john wayne fell in love with me or why he left me, do you? nl “we can’t do this anymore,” john wayne said to etta joseph. nl it was the last day of shooting. natalie wood had already gone home; john wayne had already saved her from the indians. nl “i’m going back to hollywood,” he said. nl etta wept. nl “i knew this day would come,” she said. “and i understand. you’re a family man.” nl “yes, my family needs me,” he said. “but more than that, my country needs me. they need me to be john wayne.” nl he kissed her then, one last kiss, and gave her his cowboy hat. she never wore it, not once, and gave it to her next lover, a rodeo indian who lost it somewhere at a powwow in arlee, montana. nl q: i don’t want to insult an elder. i know, within the indigenous cultures, that we’re supposed to respect our elders… nl a: oh, no, no, you’ve got that all wrong. you’re not required to respect elders. after all, most people are idiots, regardless of age. in tribal cultures, we just make sure that elders remain an active part of the culture, even if they’re idiots. especially if they’re idiots. you can’t just abandon your old people, even if they have nothing intelligent to say. even if they’re crazy. nl q: are you crazy? nl on his deathbed in a santa monica hospital, over twenty years after he’d played ethan edwards in the searchers, john wayne picked up the telephone and dialed a number that had not changed since 1952. nl “hello,” said etta when she answered. “hello, hello, hello.” nl john wayne listened to her voice. he didn’t know what to say. he hadn’t talked to her since that night in monument valley, when he’d climbed into the bed of a travelling pickup, and stood tall and proud—with the sun rising, of all things—and watched etta get smaller and smaller on the horizon. nl what was the last thing he’d said to her before he left her forever? he couldn’t remember now—the painkiller, chemotherapy, and exhaustion all played tricks with his memory—but he knew it was something he should not have said. and what was he supposed to say to her now, all these years later, as he lay dying? should he apologize, confess, repent? he had lived a large and brilliant life with his wife and sons—he’d loved them and been loved with tenderness—but he had often thought of that tiny and lovely spokane indian woman who was all alone and lost in the navajo desert. he knew he was going to die soon—and would, in fact, die later that night with his wife and sons at his bedside—but he wanted to leave the world without his earthly doubts and fears. but how could he tell etta that? how could he tell her the story of his last twenty years, how could he listen to her story of the last twenty years, and how could either of them find enough time and forgiveness for each other? nl john wayne held the telephone close to his mouth and eyes and wept his way across all of the miles and years. nl “marion?” asked etta. “marion, is that you?” nl q: is that everything? nl a: it’s all i can remember. quite an example of the oral tradition, enit? nl q: lovely. but i wonder, how much of it is true and how much of it is lies? nl a: well, now, an indian has to keep her secrets, or she’s just not indian. but an indian a lot smarter than me once said this: if it’s fiction, then it better be true. nl q: how oxymoronic. nl a: yeah, kind of like saying native american. that’s an oxymoron for you. nl q: well, i better get going. i got to find a flight to california. nl a: good for you. but don’t you want to talk about powwow dancing? nl q: well, sure, what would you like to say? nl a: i was the worst powwow dancer in the world. i’d start dancing at some powwow, and the master of ceremonies would shout out, “hey, stop the powwow, stop the powwow, etta is dancing, she’s ruining ten thousand years of tribal traditions. if we don’t stop the powwow now, she might start singing, and then we’re really going to be in trouble.” nl q: well, i suppose that’s not going to help my thesis. nl a: no, i suppose not. but my sons are really good powwow dancers. they still like to dance now and again. nl q: your sons? my god, how old are they? nl a: one hundred years old today. they’re twins. i have nine children, thirty-two grandchildren, one hundred and three great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great-grandchild. i’ve made my own damn tribe. nl q: i’d love to talk to your sons. where are they, on the reservation? nl a: oh, no, they live up on the men’s floor here. i baked them a cake. my whole family is coming. nl q: your sons, what are their names? nl a: oh, look, here thy come now. they’re early. boys, i’d like you to meet dr. spencer cox, he’s a good friend of the indians. dr. cox, i’d like you to meet my sons, marion and john. nl sitting alone in his car outside of the retirement home, spencer ejected the cassette tape from the recorder. he could destroy the tape or keep it; he could erase etta’s voice or transcribe it. it didn’t matter what he chose to do with her story because the story would continue to exist with or without him. was the story true or false? was that the question spencer needed to ask? nl inside, an old woman kneeled in a circle with her loved ones and led them in prayer. nl outside, a white man closed his eyes and prayed to the ghosts of john wayne, ethan edwards, and marion morrison, that holy trinity. nl somebody said nothing and somebody said amen, amen, amen."

25,Mondo Loops,Terrapin (Original Mix),"angelina jolie nl in the days that followed, xian took me along to his business meetings. he seemed to enjoy my company as he went about his day or ate his lunch. i either talked too much or too little, both of which he liked. i followed how the seeds of money are sown and cultivated, how the economy’s terrain is allowed to lie fallow. we went to las vegas, an area to the north of naples. las vegas: that’s what we call it around here, for several reasons. just like las vegas, nevada, which is built in the middle of the desert, the urban agglomerations here seem to spring up out of nothing. and you have to cross a desert of roads to reach the place. miles of tar, wide thoroughfares that whisk you away from here, propelling you toward the highway, to rome, straight to the north. roads built not for cars but for trucks, not to move people but clothes, shoes, purses. as you arrive from naples, these towns appear out of nowhere, planted in the ground one after another. lumps of cement. tangles of streets. a web of roads on which the towns of casavatore, caivano, sant’antimo, melito, arzano, piscinola, san pietro a patierno, frattamaggiore, frattaminore, grumo nevano, endlessly rotate. places so indistinguishable they seem to be one giant metropolis, with the streets of one town running into another. nl i must have heard the area around foggia called califoggia a hundred times, the southern part of calabria referred to as calafrica or saudi calabria, sala consilina sahara consilina, or an area of secondigliano (which means “second mile”) called terzo mondo, third world. but this las vegas really is las vegas. for years, anyone who wanted to try his hand at business could do it here. live the dream. use his severance pay, savings, or a loan to open a factory. you’d bet on a company: if you won, you’d reap efficiency, productivity, speed, protection, and cheap labor. you’d win just the way you win by betting on red or black. if you lost, you’d be out of business in a few months. las vegas. no regulations, no administrative or economic planning. shoes, clothes, and accessories were clandestinely forced onto the international market. the towns didn’t boast of this precious production; the more silently, the more secretly the goods were manufactured, the more successful they were. for years this area produced the best in italian fashion. and thus the best in the world. but they didn’t have entrepreneurs’ clubs or training centers; they had nothing but work, nothing but their sewing machines, small factories, wrapped packages, and shipped goods. nothing but the endless repetition of production. everything else was superfluous. training took place at the workbench, and a company’s quality was demonstrated by its success. no financing, no projects, no internships. in the marketplace it’s all or nothing. win or lose. a rise in salaries has meant better houses and fancy cars. yet this is not wealth that can be considered collective. this is plundered wealth, taken by force from someone else and carried off to your own cave. people came from all over to invest in businesses making shirts, jackets, skirts, blazers, gloves, hats, purses, and wallets for italian, german, and french companies. las vegas stopped requiring permits, contracts, or proper working conditions in the 1950s, and garages, stairwells, and storerooms were transformed into factories. but lately the chinese competition has ruined the ones producing midrange-quality merchandise. there’s no more room for workmanship. either you do the best work the fastest or someone else will figure out how to do average work more quickly. a lot of people found themselves out of work. factory owners were crushed by debt and usury. many absconded. nl one place in particular has been threatened by the disappearance of these midrange industries: parco verde in caivano. its breath cut short, its growth stunted, it has become the emblem of the outer edge of urban sprawl. here the lights are always on, the houses full of people, the courtyards crowded, the cars parked. no one leaves. some people arrive, but few stay. there’s never a moment when the apartment houses are empty, never that sense of stillness after everyone has gone off to work or school in the morning. there’s always a crowd here, the incessant noise of people. nl parco verde rises up just off the central axis of the city, the knife of tar that slices right through naples. it seems more like a junk pile than a neighborhood, cement constructions with aluminum balconies swelling like carbuncles from every opening. it looks like one of those places an architect who got his inspiration at the beach designed, as if he’d meant the buildings to look like sand castles, the kind made from pails of sand dumped upside down. dull, featureless buildings. in one corner is a tiny chapel. you almost don’t notice it, but that wasn’t always the case. there used to be a big, white chapel, a full-scale mausoleum dedicated to a boy named emanuele. emanuele was killed on the job. a job that in some places is even worse than moonlighting in a factory. but it’s a way to make a living. emanuele did robberies. he’d strike on saturdays—every saturday. always in the same place. same time, same street, same day. because saturday was the day for his victims, the day for lovers. and route 87 was where all the lovers in the area went. a shitty road of patched tar and mini-landfills. every time i pass there and see the couples, i think you must have to really unleash a lot of passion to feel good in such a disgusting setting. it was here that emanuele and his two friends hid, waiting for a car to park, for the lights to be switched off. they’d wait a few more minutes—to give them time to get undressed—and then, when the lovers were most vulnerable, they’d strike. they’d shatter the window with the butt of a pistol and stick the barrel under the man’s nose. after cleaning out their victims, they’d head off for the weekend with dozens of robberies under their belts and 500 euros in their pockets: meager booty, but it felt like a fortune. nl then one night a patrol of carabinieri intercepts them. emanuele and his accomplices are so reckless that they don’t realize that constantly pulling the same moves in the same location is the best way to get arrested. a chase, the cars ram into each other, shots ring out. then all is still. emanuele is in the car, mortally wounded. he’d pointed a pistol at the carabinieri, so they kill him, eleven shots in just a few seconds. firing eleven shots at point-blank means your gun is aimed and you’re ready to shoot at the least provocation. shoot to kill first, and think of it as self-defense later. the bullets had flown in like the wind, drawn to emanuele’s body as to a magnet. his friends stop the car and are about to flee, but give up as soon as they realize emanuele is dead. they open the car doors, putting up no resistance to the fists in the face that are a prelude to every arrest. emanuele is bent over himself, a fake pistol in his hand. a cap gun, the kind that used to be called a dog-chaser, good for keeping stray dogs out of the chicken coop. a toy wielded as if it were real; after all, emanuele was a kid who acted like a grown man, with a frightened look that feigned ruthlessness, and a desire for pocket money that pretended to be a thirst for riches. emanuele was fifteen years old. everyone called him manù. he had a lean, dark, angular face, the kind you picture when you imagine the last kid you’d want to hang out with. emanuele came from a corner of the world where you don’t win honor and respect merely for having pocket money, but for how you get it. emanuele belonged to parco verde. and when you come from a place that brands you, no mistake or crime can cancel out the fact of your belonging. the parco verde families took up a collection and built a small mausoleum. inside they placed an image of the neapolitan madonna dell’arco and a photo of emanuele smiling. emanuele’s chapel was one of the more than twenty the faithful had built in honor of every madonna imaginable. but the mayor couldn’t stand that this one was dedicated to a lowlife, so he sent in a bulldozer to knock it down. the cement building crumbled instantly, as if it were made out of modeling clay. word spread quickly, and the youth of parco verde arrived on their vespas and motorcycles. no one spoke. they all just stared at the man working the bulldozer levers. under the weight of their gaze, he stopped and pointed to the marshal as if to say that he was the one who’d given the order. a gesture to identify the object of their wrath and remove the target from his own chest. frightened, besieged, he locked himself in. a second later the fighting began. he managed to flee in a police car as the kids began attacking the bulldozer with fists and feet. they emptied beer bottles and filled them with gas, tilting their motor scooters to drain the fuel right into the bottles, and threw rocks at the windows of a nearby school. if emanuele’s chapel had to come down, then so did all the rest. dishes, vases, and silverware flew from apartment windows. firebombs were hurled at the police. trash cans were lined up as barricades, and everything they could get their hands on was set on fire. preparations for guerrilla warfare. there were hundreds of them, they’d be able to hold out a long time. the rebellion was spreading, and soon it would reach naples proper. nl but then someone arrived, from not too far away. the whole area was surrounded by police and carabinieri cars, but a black suv had managed to get past the barricades. the driver gave a signal, someone opened the door, and a few of the rebels got in. in less than two hours everything was dismantled. handkerchiefs came off faces, barricades of burning trash were extinguished. the clans had intervened, who knows which one. parco verde is a gold mine for camorra laborers. anyone who wants conscripts can round them up here: the bottom rung, unskilled workers who make even less than the nigerian or albanian pushers. everybody wants parco verde kids: the casalesi clan, the mallardos in giuliano, the crispano “tiger cubs.” they become drug dealers on fixed pay, with no percentage on their sales, or drivers, or lookouts, defending territories miles from home. and to get the job they don’t even ask to be reimbursed for gas. trustworthy kids, scrupulous in their work. some wind up on heroin, the drug of the truly wretched. some save themselves, enlist in the army, and get deployed; some of the girls manage to get away and never set foot in the place again. hardly any of the younger generation become clan members; they work for the clans without ever becoming camorristi. the clans don’t want them. they merely employ them, take advantage of the offering. these kids have no skills or commercial talent. a lot of them work as couriers, carrying backpacks filled with hashish to rome. motorcycle muscles flexed to the max, after an hour and a half they’re already at the capital gates. they don’t get anything for these trips, but after about twenty rounds they’re given a present—a motorcycle. to them it’s precious, beyond compare, out of reach with any other job available around here. they’ve been delivering goods that bring in ten times the cost of the motorcycle, but they don’t know that, can’t even begin to imagine it. if they get stopped at a roadblock, they’ll get less than ten years. the clan won’t cover their legal costs or guarantee assistance to their families. but there’s the roar of the exhaust in their ears and rome to reach. nl a few of the barricades came down slowly, depending on the degree of pent-up anger. then everything fizzled. the clans weren’t afraid of the revolt. as far as they were concerned, parco verde could burn for days, the inhabitants could all kill each other. except that the uproar meant no work, no reserves of cheap labor. everything had to return to normal right away. everyone had to get back to work, or at least be ready if they were needed. this game of revolt had to end. nl  nl i went to emanuele’s funeral. in certain spots on the globe, fifteen is merely a number. in this slum neighborhood, dying at fifteen is more like fulfilling a death sentence than being deprived of life. the church was filled with grim-faced kids, and every now and then they’d let out a moan. outside, a small chorus was even chanting, “he’s still with us, he’ll always be with us …” what soccer fanatics shout when some old glory retires his number. it was as if they were at the stadium, but the only chants were ones of rage. the plainclothesmen did their best to keep out of the aisles. everyone had recognized them but there was no room for a skirmish. i’d spotted them right away; or rather they’d spotted me, not finding any trace of my face in their mental archives. as if attracted by my sullenness, one of them came up to me and said, “they’re all doomed here. drugs, stealing, dealing in stolen goods, holdups … some are even streetwalkers. not one of them is clean. the more of them who die here, the better it is for everyone.” nl words that deserve a punch or a head butt in the nose. but everyone was really thinking the same thing. and maybe they had a point. i looked at them one by one, those kids who’ll do life for stealing 200 euros—the dregs, stand-ins, pushers. not one of them over twenty. padre mauro, the priest performing emanuele’s funeral, knew whom he was burying. he also knew the other kids were hardly the picture of innocence. nl “this is not a hero who has died today …” nl he didn’t hold his hands open as priests do when they read the parables on sunday, but instead clenched his fists. and there was no note of homily in his voice, which was strangely hoarse, as if he’d been talking too long. he spoke with anger—there was no light punishment for this creature, no delegating anything. nl he seemed like one of those priests during the guerrilla uprisings in el salvador, when they’d finally had enough of performing funerals for murder victims, when they stopped having pity and started shouting. but no one knew romero here. padre mauro had unusual energy. “for all the responsibility we can assign to emanuele, the fact remains that he was fifteen years old. at that age the sons of families born in other parts of italy are going to the pool, taking dance lessons. it’s not like that here. god the father will take into consideration the fact that the mistake was made by a fifteen-year-old boy. if in the south of italy fifteen means you’re old enough to work, to decide to steal, to kill and be killed, it also means you’re old enough to take responsibility for certain things.” nl he inhaled deeply the foul air inside the church. “but fifteen years are few enough that they let us see more clearly what’s behind them, and they require us to apportion the responsibility. fifteen is an age that knocks at the conscience of those who merely play at legality, work, and responsibility. an age that doesn’t knock gently, but claws with its nails.” nl the priest finished the homily. no one was completely sure what he really meant or who was to blame. the kids got all riled up. four men carried the casket out of the church, but all of a sudden it lifted off their shoulders and floated above the crowd, swaying on a sea of hands, like a rock star who catapults from the stage into his fans. a bunch of motorcyclists pulled up around the hearse waiting to take manù to the cemetery. they revved their engines and clamped down on the brakes: a chorus of burnouts for emanuele’s last race. their tires squealing and mufflers howling, it was as if they wanted to escort him all the way to the hereafter. thick smoke and the stench of gas filled the air, permeating everyone’s clothes. i went in to the sacristy; i wanted to talk to the priest who’d uttered such fiery words. a woman got there before me. she wanted to tell him that the boy had gone looking for trouble, that his family hadn’t taught him anything. then she confessed proudly, “my grandchildren would never have committed robbery, even though they’re unemployed … but what did that boy learn?” she continued nervously. “anything?” nl the priest looked at the floor. he was wearing a tracksuit. he didn’t try to respond, didn’t even look her in the face. he just kept staring at his sneakers as he whispered, “the fact is that the only thing you learn here is how to die.” nl “excuse me, padre?” nl “nothing, signora, nothing.” nl but not everyone is underground here. not everyone has ended up in the quagmire of defeat. at least not yet. some successful factories are still strong enough to compete with the chinese because they work for big designer names. by delivering speed and quality—extremely high quality—they still hold the monopoly on beauty for top-level garments. “made in italy” is made here. caivano, sant’ antimo, arzano, and all across las vegas, campania. “the face of italy in the world” wears fabric draped over the bare head of the naples suburbs. the brand names don’t dare risk sending everything east, contracting out to asia. factories here are crowded into stairwells, on the ground floors of row houses, in sheds on the outskirts of these outlying towns. lined up one behind the other, staring at the back of the person in front of them, the workers sew cloth, cut leather, and assemble shoes. a garment worker puts in about ten hours a day, bringing home from 500 to 900 euros a month. overtime usually pays well, as much as 15 euros an hour more than the regular wage. factories rarely have more than ten employees. there’s almost always a television or radio so the workers can listen to music, maybe even hum along. but during crunch times the only noise is the march of needles. more than half the employees are women; they’re skilled workers, born staring at a sewing machine. officially these factories don’t exist, and neither do the employees. if the same work were done legally, prices would go up and there’d be no more market—which means the work would disappear from italy. the businessmen around here know this logic by heart. there’s usually no rancor or resentment between factory workers and owners; class conflict here is as soft as a soggy cookie. often the owner is a former worker, and he puts in the same hours as his employees, in the same room, at the same bench. when he makes a mistake, he pays for it out of his own pocket, in mortgages or loans. his authority is paternalistic. you have to fight for a day off or a few cents’ raise. there’s no contract, no bureaucracy. it’s all head to head, and any concessions or benefits are individually negotiated. the owner and his family live above the factory. his daughters often babysit his employees’ children, and his mother becomes their de facto grandmother, so that workers’ and owner’s children grow up together. this communal existence acts out the horizontal dream of post-fordism:* workers and managers eat together, socialize with each other, and are made to feel they’re all part of the same community. nl no one acts ashamed here. they know they’re doing top-quality work, and that they’re being paid a pittance. but you can’t have one without the other. you work to get what you need and you do it as best you can, so that no one will find any reason to fire you. no safety net, just cause, sick leave, or vacation days. it’s up to you to negotiate your rights, to plead for time off. but there’s nothing to complain about. everything is just as it should be. here there’s only a body, a skill, a machine, and a salary. no one knows the exact number of clandestine workers in these parts, or how many legal employees are forced to sign a monthly pay slip for sums they never receive. nl  nl xian was to take part in an auction. we went to an elementary-school classroom, but there were no children and no teacher, just sheets of construction paper with big letters tacked to the walls. about twenty company reps were milling around. xian was the only foreigner. he only greeted two people, and without excessive familiarity. a car pulled into the school courtyard, and three people entered the room: two men and a woman. the woman was wearing a leather skirt and high-heeled patent-leather shoes. everyone rose to greet her. they took their places and the auction began. one of the men drew three vertical lines on the blackboard and wrote as the woman dictated. in the first column: nl “800” nl this was the number of garments to make. the woman listed the types of fabric and the quality of the articles. a businessman from sant’ antimo went over to the window, turning his back to the rest of us, and offered his prices and times: nl “forty euros apiece in two months.” nl his proposal was written on the board: nl “800/40/2” nl the other businessmen didn’t look worried. he hadn’t dared enter the realm of the impossible, which evidently was to their liking. but not to the buyers’. so the bidding continued. nl the auctions the big italian brands hold in this area are strange. no one wins the contract and no one loses. the game consists in entering or not entering the race. someone throws out an offer, stating his time and price. if his conditions are accepted, he won’t be the only winner, however. his offer is like a head start the others can try to follow. when the brokers accept a bid, the other contractors decide if they want in; whoever agrees gets the fabric. it’s sent directly to the port of naples, where the contractors pick it up. but only one of them will be paid: the one who delivers first, and with top-quality merchandise. the other players are free to keep the fabric, but they don’t get a cent. the fashion houses make so much money that material isn’t a loss worth considering. if a contractor takes advantage of the system to have free fabric but repeatedly fails to deliver, he’s excluded from future auctions. in this way the brokers are guaranteed speed: if someone falls behind, someone else will take his place. there’s no relief from the rhythms of high fashion. nl to the joy of the woman behind the desk, another hand went up. a well-dressed contractor, elegant. nl “twenty euros in twenty-five days.” nl in the end the bid was accepted. nine of the twenty contractors signed on as well. but not xian. he wouldn’t have been able to coordinate quality and speed in such a short time and at such low prices. when the auction was over, the woman wrote up a list of the contractors’ names and phone numbers and the addresses of their factories. the winner invited everyone to his house for lunch. his factory was on the ground floor, he and his wife lived on the second, his son on the third. “i’m applying for a permit to add another floor. my other son is getting married,” he declared proudly. as we climbed the stairs, he continued to tell us about his family, which, like his villa, was under construction. nl “don’t ever put men in charge of the female workers, it only causes problems. i’ve got two sons, and both of them married employees. put the fags in charge. make the fags manage the shifts and inspect the work, like in the old days …” nl the workers, men and women, came up to toast the new contract. they faced a grueling schedule: first shift from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., with an hour’s break to eat, second shift from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. the women were wearing makeup and earrings, and aprons to protect their clothes from the glue, dust, and machine grease. like superman, who takes off his shirt and reveals his blue costume underneath, they were ready to go out to dinner as soon as they removed their aprons. the men were sloppier, in sweatshirts and work pants. after the toast one of the guests took the owner aside, along with the others who had agreed to the auction price. they weren’t hiding, but simply respecting the ancient custom of not discussing money at table. xian explained to me in great detail that the guest—the very image of a bank teller—was discussing interest rates. but he was not from a bank. italian brands pay only when the work is completed. or rather, only after it has been accepted. everything—salaries, production costs, even shipping—must be paid in advance by the manufacturers, so the clans loan money to the factories in their territories. the di lauros in arzano, the verdes in sant’ antimo, the cennamos in crispano, and so on. the camorra offers low rates, 2 to 4 percent. no one should have an easier time obtaining bank credit than these companies, who produce for the italian fashion world, for the market of markets. but they’re phantom operations, and bank directors don’t meet with ghosts. camorra liquidity is also the only way for factory employees to obtain a mortgage. thus in towns where more than 40 percent of the residents support themselves by moonlighting, six out of ten families still manage to buy a home. even the contractors who don’t satisfy the requirements of the designer labels manage to find a buyer. they sell the garments to the clans to be put on the fake-goods market. all the runway fashions, all the glitz for the most elegant premieres, comes from here. the las vegas towns and casarano, tricase, taviano, and melissano in capo di leuca, the lower salento region, are the principal centers for black-market fashion. it all comes from here, from this hole. all merchandise has obscure origins: such is the law of capitalism. but to observe the hole, to see it in front of you, well, it causes a strange sensation. an anxious heaviness. like the truth weighing on your stomach. nl one of the winning contractor’s workers was particularly skilled: pasquale. a lanky figure, tall, slim, and a bit hunchbacked; his frame curved behind his neck onto his shoulders, a bit like a hook. the stylists sent designs directly to him, articles intended for his hands only. his salary didn’t fluctuate, but his tasks varied, and he some how conveyed an air of satisfaction. i liked him immediately, the moment i caught sight of his big nose. even though he was still young, pasquale had the face of an old man. a face that was constantly buried in fabric, fingertips that ran along seams. pasquale was one of the only workers who could buy fabric direct. some brandname houses even trusted him to order materials directly from china and inspect the quality himself. which is why he and xian knew each other. they’d met at the port. one day we all had lunch together there. when we finished eating, we said goodbye to pasquale, and xian and i got in the car and headed toward vesuvius. volcanoes are usually depicted in dark colors, but vesuvius is green; from a distance, it’s a vast mantle of moss. but before we got to the turnoff for the towns around vesuvius, the car pulled into the courtyard of a building. pasquale was there waiting for us. i had no idea why. pasquale got out of his car and climbed straight into the trunk of xian’s. nl “what’s going on? why’s he getting in the trunk?” nl “don’t worry. now we’ll go to terzigno, to the factory.” nl a sort of minotaur figure got in behind the wheel. he’d been in pasquale’s car and seemed to know exactly what to do. he put the engine in reverse, backed out the gate, and, before pulling out into the street, produced a pistol. a semiautomatic. he racked a round and stuck it between his legs. i didn’t breathe, but the minotaur, catching sight of me in the rearview mirror, realized i was staring at him anxiously. nl “they tried to do us in once.” nl “who?” nl i tried to get him to explain it all from the beginning. nl “the ones who don’t want the chinese learning to work in high fashion. the ones who just want fabric from china, nothing else.” nl i didn’t understand. i just didn’t understand. xian intervened, in his usual soothing way. nl “pasquale’s helping us learn how to make the quality garments they don’t trust us with yet. we’re learning how to make clothes from him.” nl after xian’s explanation, the minotaur attempted to justify the pistol:“so … one of them popped up there once, right there, see, in the middle of the piazza, and fired on our car. hit the motor and windshield wipers. if they’d wanted to, they could’ve bumped us off. but it was just a warning. if they try it again though, this time i’m ready.” nl the minotaur explained that the best technique when driving is to keep the pistol between your thighs. putting it on the dashboard slows you down—you lose too much time grabbing it. the road to terzigno is uphill, and i could smell the clutch burning. i was less afraid of a burst of submachine-gun fire than the recoil of the engine, which might make the pistol fire into the driver’s scrotum. we arrived without a hitch. as soon as the car came to a stop, xian went and opened the trunk. pasquale got out, looking like a balled-up kleenex trying to flatten itself out. he came over to me and said: nl “it’s the same story every time. not even a fugitive hides like this … but it’s better they don’t see me in the car, or else …” nl he sliced a finger across his neck. the factory was big, but not enormous. xian had described it to me proudly. it belonged to him, but housed nine microfactories of nine chinese entrepreneurs. it was like a chessboard inside: each factory had a square, with its own workers and benches. xian had given each company the same amount of space as the factories in las vegas, and the contracts were auctioned off using the same method. he’d decided not to let children into the work zone and had organized the shifts as in italian factories. what’s more, when they did work for other companies, they didn’t ask for cash up front. in short, xian was becoming a serious player in the italian fashion business. nl chinese factories in china were competing with chinese factories in italy. as a result prato, rome, and the chinatowns of half of italy were suffering terribly; they’d experienced such a quick boom that the collapse felt even more sudden. there was only one way for the chinese factories in italy to save themselves: they had to become fashion experts, capable of doing top-quality work. they had to learn from the italians, from the las vegas factory owners, to go from being junk manufacturers to the brands’ trusted suppliers in southern italy. they had to take the place of the italian underground factories, appropriate their logic, workspaces, and language. they had to do the same work, but for a little less money and in a little less time. nl pasquale took some fabric out of a suitcase: a dress he was supposed to cut and sew in his factory. he did it here instead, on a table in front of a camera, his image projected onto a sheet hanging behind him. as he talked, a girl with a microphone translated into chinese. this was his fifth lesson. nl “you must take great care with the seams. the seam has to be light but not nonexistent.” nl the chinese triangle: san giuseppe vesuviano, terzigno, ottaviano. the hub of the chinese clothing business. everything that’s happening in the chinese communities of italy happened first in terzigno. the first production cycles, the first quality manufacturing, as well as the first murders. this is where wang dingjm was killed. a forty-year-old immigrant who’d driven down from rome for a party some other chinese were throwing. they invited him, then shot him in the head. wang was a snakehead—a scout—tied to the criminal cartels in beijing that organize the clandestine entry of chinese into italy. trafficking in humans, the snakeheads often clash with their clients. they promise a certain quantity and then they don’t deliver. just as a drug dealer is killed when he keeps back a part of his earnings, a snakehead is killed when he cheats on his goods, on human beings. but it’s not just mafiosi who die. on one of the factory doors was the photo of a young girl. pretty face, pink cheeks, eyes so dark they seemed painted. it was hung exactly where one would traditionally expect the yellow face of mao, but this was a picture of zhang xiangbi, a pregnant girl who had been killed a few years earlier. she used to work here. a mechanic from these parts had fancied her; she used to walk past his garage, and liking what he saw, he decided that was reason enough to have her. the chinese work like dogs, they slither like snakes, they’re quieter than deaf-mutes, they’re not allowed any means of resistance or free will. such is the axiom everyone—or almost everyone—bears in mind. but zhang had resisted. she tried to escape when the mechanic came near her, but she couldn’t report him. she was chinese, and every sign of visibility was denied her. the next time the man didn’t take no for an answer. he beat and kicked her until she fainted, then slit her throat and threw her body in a deep well, where it remained for days, bloated with water. pasquale knew this story and was devastated by it. every time he went to give a lesson, he made sure to go over to zhang’s brother and ask how he was, see if he needed anything. but he always got the same response: “nothing, thanks.” nl pasquale and i became close. he was like a prophet when he spoke about fabric and was overly fastidious in clothing stores; it was impossible even to go for a stroll with him because he’d plant himself in front of every shop window and criticize the cut of a jacket or feel ashamed for the tailor who’d designed such a skirt. he could predict the longevity of a particular style of pants, jacket, or dress, and the exact number of washings before the fabric would start to sag. pasquale initiated me into the complicated world of textiles. i even started going to his home. his family—his wife and three children—made me happy. they were always busy without ever being frenetic. that evening the smaller children were running around the house barefoot as usual, but without making a racket. pasquale had turned on the television and was flipping channels, but all of a sudden he froze. he squinted at the screen, as if he were nearsighted, though he could see perfectly well. no one was talking, but the silence became more intense. his wife, luisa, must have sensed something because she went over to the television and clasped her hand over her mouth, as if she’d just witnessed something terrible and were holding back a scream. on tv angelina jolie was treading the red carpet at the oscars, dressed in a gorgeous garment. one of those custom-made outfits that italian designers fall over each other to offer to the stars. an outfit that pasquale had made in an underground factory in arzano. all they’d said to him was “this one’s going to america.” pasquale had worked on hundreds of outfits going to america, but that white suit was something else. he still remembered all the measurements. the cut of the neck, the circumference of the wrists. and the pants. he’d run his hands inside the legs and could still picture the naked body that every tailor forms in his mind—not an erotic figure but one defined by the curves of muscles, the ceramics of bones. a body to dress, a meditation of muscle, bone, and bearing. pasquale still remembered the day he’d gone to the port to pick up the fabric. they’d commissioned three suits from him, without saying anything else. they knew whom they were for, but no one had told pasquale. nl in japan the tailor of the bride to the heir to the throne had had a state reception given in his honor. a berlin newspaper had dedicated six pages to the tailor of germany’s first woman chancellor, pages that spoke of craftsmanship, imagination, and elegance. pasquale was filled with rage, a rage that it’s impossible to express. and yet satisfaction is a right, and merit deserves recognition. deep in his gut he knew he’d done a superb job and he wanted to be able to say so. he knew he deserved something more. but no one had said a word to him. he’d discovered it by accident, by mistake. his rage was an end in itself, justified but pointless. he couldn’t tell anyone, couldn’t even whisper as he sat looking at the newspaper the next morning. he couldn’t say, “i made that suit.” no one would have believed that angelina jolie would go to the academy awards wearing an outfit made in arzano, by pasquale. the best and the worst. millions of dollars and 600 euros a month. neither angelina jolie nor the designer could have known. when everything possible has been done, when talent, skill, ability, and commitment are fused in a single act, when all this isn’t enough to change anything, then you just want to lie down, stretch out on nothing, in nothing. to vanish slowly, let the minutes wash over you, sink into them as if they were quicksand. to do nothing but breathe. besides, nothing will change things, not even an outfit for angelina jolie at the oscars. nl pasquale left the house without even bothering to shut the door. luisa knew where he was going; she knew he was headed to secondigliano and whom he was going to see. she threw herself on the couch and buried her face in a pillow like a child. i don’t know why, but when luisa started to cry, it made me think of a poem by vittorio bodini. lines that tell of the strategies southern italian peasants used to keep from becoming soldiers, to avoid going off to fill the trenches of world war i in defense of borders they knew nothing of. nl at the time of the other war peasants and smugglers nl put tobacco leaves under their arms nl to make themselves ill. nl the artificial fevers, the supposed malaria nl that made their bodies tremble and their teeth rattle nl were their verdict nl on governments and history. nl that’s how luisa’s weeping seemed to me—a verdict on government and history. not a lament for a satisfaction that went uncelebrated. it seemed to me an amended chapter of marx’s capital, a paragraph added to adam smith’s the wealth of nations, a new sentence in john maynard keynes’s general theory of employment, interest and money, a note in max weber’s the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism. a page added or removed, a forgotten page that never got written or that perhaps was written many times over but never recorded on paper. not a desperate act but an analysis. severe, detailed, precise, reasoned. i imagined pasquale in the street, stomping his feet as if knocking snow from his boots. like a child who is surprised to discover that life has to be so painful. he’d managed up till then. managed to hold himself back, to do his job, to want to do it. and do it better than anyone else. but the minute he saw that outfit, saw that body moving inside the very fabric he’d caressed, he felt alone, all alone. because when you know something only within the confines of your own flesh and blood, it’s as if you don’t really know it. and when work is only about staying afloat, surviving, when it’s merely an end in itself, it becomes the worst kind of loneliness. nl i saw pasquale two months later. they’d put him on truck detail. he hauled all sorts of stuff—legal and illegal—for the licciardi family businesses. or at least that’s what they said. the best tailor in the world was driving trucks for the camorra, back and forth between secondigliano and lago di garda. he asked me to lunch and gave me a ride in his enormous vehicle. his hands were red, his knuckles split. as with every truck driver who grips a steering wheel for hours, his hands freeze up and his circulation is bad. his expression was troubled; he’d chosen the job out of spite, out of spite for his destiny, a kick in the ass of his life. but you can’t tolerate things indefinitely, even if walking away means you’re worse off. during lunch he got up to go say hello to some of his accomplices, leaving his wallet on the table. a folded-up page from a newspaper fell out. i opened it. it was a photograph, a cover shot of angelina jolie dressed in white. she was wearing the suit pasquale had made, the jacket caressing her bare skin. you need talent to dress skin without hiding it; the fabric has to follow the body, has to be designed to trace its movements. nl i’m sure that every once in a while, when he’s alone, maybe when he’s finished eating, when the children have fallen asleep on the couch, worn-out from playing, while his wife is talking on the phone with her mother before starting on the dishes, right at that moment pasquale opens his wallet and stares at that newspaper photo. and i’m sure that he’s happy as he looks at the masterpiece he created with his own hands. a rabid happiness. but no one will ever know."

30,dryhope,Ever Forward," but the queen, long since smitten with a grievous love-pang, feeds the wound with her lifeblood, and is wasted with fire unseen. oft to her mind rushes back the hero’s valour, oft his glorious stock; his looks and words cling fast to her bosom, and longing withholds calm rest from her limbs. nl  the morrow’s dawn was lighting the earth with the lamp of phoebus, and had scattered from the sky the dewy shades, when, much distraught, she thus speaks to her sister, sharer of her heart: “anna, my sister, what dreams thrill me with fears? who is this stranger guest who ahs entered our home? how noble his mien! how brave in heart and feats of arms! i believe it well – nor is my confidence vain – that he is sprung from gods. it is fear that proves souls base-born. alas! by what fates is he vexed! what wars, long endured, did he recount! were the purpose not planted in my mind, fixed and immovable, to ally myself with none in bond of wedlock, since my first love, turning traitor, cheated me by death; were i not tired of the bridal bed and torch, to this one fault, perhaps, i might have yielded! anna – for i will own it – since the death of my hapless lord sychaeus, and the shattering of our home by a brother’s murder, he alone has swayed my will and overthrown my tottering soul. i feel again a spark of that former flame. but rather, i would pray, may earth yawn for me to its depths, or may the almighty father hurl me with his bolt to the shades – the pale shades and abysmal night in erebus – before, shame, i violate you or break your laws! he who first linked me to himself has taken away my heart; may he keep it with him, and guard it in the grave!” so saying, she filled her breast with upwelling tears. nl  anna replies: “o you who are dearer to your sister than the light, are you, lonely and sad, going to pine away all your youth long, and know not sweet children or love’s rewards? do you think that dust or buried shades give heed to that? grant that until now no wooers moved your sorrow, not in libya, not before then in tyre; that iarbas was slighted, and other lords whom the african land, rich in triumphs, rears; will you wrestle also with a love that pleases? and does it not come to your mind whose lands you have settled in? on this side gaetulian cities, a race invincible in war, unbridled numidians, and the unfriendly syrtis hem you in; on that side lies a tract barren with drought, and barcaeans, raging far and wide. why speak of the wars rising from tyre, your brother’s threats . . . ? i certainly believe that it was with the gods’ favour and juno’s aid that the ilian ships held their course hither with the wind. what a city you will see rise here, my sister, what a realm, by reason of such a marriage! with teucrian arms beside us, to what heights will punic glory soar? only ask favour of the gods and, with sacrifice duly offered, be lavish with your welcome, and weave pleas for delay, while at sea winter rages fiercely and orion is stormy – while the ships are shattered, and the skies intractable!” nl  with these words she fanned into flame the queen’s love-enkindled heart, put hope in her wavering mind, and loosed the bonds of shame. first they visit the shrines and sue for peace at every altar; duly they slay chosen sheep to ceres the law-giver, to phoebus and father lyaeus, above all to juno, guardian of the bonds of marriage. dido herself, matchless in beauty, with cup in hand, pours libation midway between the horns of a white heifer, or in presence of the gods moves slowly to the rich altars, and day by day renews her gifts, then, gazing into the opened breasts of victims, consults the quivering entrails. ah, the blind souls of seers! of what avail are vows or shrines to one wild with love? all the while the flame devours her tender heartstrings, and deep in her breast lives the silent wound. unhappy dido burns, and through the city wanders in frenzy – even as a hind, smitten by an arrow, which, all unwary, amid the cretan woods, a shepherd hunting with darts has pierced from afar, leaving in her the winged steel, unknowing: she in flight ranges the dictaean woods and glades, but fast to her side clings the deadly shaft. now through the city’s midst she leads aeneas with her, and displays her sidonian wealth and the city built; she begins to speak and stops with the word half-spoken. now, as day wanes, she seeks that same banquet, again in her madness craves to hear the sorrows of ilium and again hangs on the speaker’s lips. then when all have gone their ways, and in turn the dim moon sinks her light, and the setting stars invite sleep, alone she mourns in the empty hall, and falls on the couch he has left. though absent, each from each, she hears him, she sees him, or, captivated by his look of his father, she holds ascanius on her lap, in case she may beguile a passion beyond all utterance. no longer rise the towers begun, no longer do the youth exercise in arms, or toil at havens or bulwarks for safety in war; the works are broken off and idle – great menacing walls and cranes that touch the sky. nl  soon as the loved wife of jove saw that dido was held in a passion so fatal, and that her good name was now no bar to her frenzy, the daughter of saturn accosts venus thus: “splendid indeed is the praise and rich the spoils you win, you and your boy; mighty and glorious is the power divine, if one woman is subdued by the guile of two gods! nay, it escapes me not how, in fear of our city, you have held in suspicion the homes of high carthage. but what shall be the end? and what is the point of all this contest now? why do we not rather strive for an enduring peace and a plighted wedlock? what you sought with all your heart you have; dido is on fire with love and has drawn the madness through her veins. let us then rule this people jointly with equal sovereignty; let her serve a phrygian husband and yield her tyrians to your power as dowry!” nl  to her – for she knew that with feigned purpose she had spoken, to turn the empire from italy to libya’s shores – venus thus began in reply: “who so mad as to refuse such terms, or prefer to strive against you in war, as long as fortune favour the fulfilment of your word? but the fates send me adrift, uncertain whether jupiter wills that there be one city for the tyrians and the wanderers from troy, or approves the blending of peoples and the league of union. you are his wife; it is lawful for you to try to persuade his heart with entreaty. go on; i will follow!” then queenly juno thus replied: “with me shall rest that task. now in what way the present purpose can be achieved, hearken and i will explain in brief. aeneas and unhappy dido plan to go hunting together in the forest, as soon as tomorrow’s sun shows his rising and with his rays unveils the world. on them, while the hunters run to and fro and gird the glades with nets, i will pour down from above a black rain mingled with hail, and wake the whole welkin with thunder. the company shall scatter and be veiled in gloom of night; to the same cave shall come dido and the trojan chief. i will be there and, if i can be sure of your good will, will link them in sure wedlock, sealing her for his own; this shall be their bridal!” yielding to her suit, the cytherean gave assent and smiled at the guile discovered. nl  meanwhile dawn rose and left the ocean. when sunlight has burst forth, there issues from the gates a chosen band of youth; with meshed nets, toils, broad-pointed hunting spears, there stream forth massylian horsemen and their strong, keen-scented hounds. as the queen lingers in her bower, the punic princes await her at the doorway; her prancing steed stands brilliant in purple and gold, and proudly champs the foaming bit. at last she comes forth, attended by a mighty throng, and clad in a sidonian robe with embroidered border. her quiver is of gold, her tresses are knotted into gold, a buckle of gold clasps her purple cloak. with her pace a phrygian train and joyous iulus. aeneas himself, goodly beyond all others, advances to join her and unites his band with hers. as when apollo quits lycia, his winter home, and the streams of xanthus, to visit his mother’s delos, and renews the dance, while mingling about his altars cretans and dryopes and painted agathyrsians raise their voices – he himself treads the cynthian ridges, and with soft foliage shapes and binds his flowing locks, braiding it with golden diadem; the shafts rattle on his shoulders: so no less lightly than he went aeneas, such beauty shines forth from his noble face! when they came to the mountain heights and pathless lairs, wild goats dislodged from the rocky peaks ran down the ridges; in another part stags scurry across the open moors and amid clouds of dust mass their bands in flight, as they leave the hills behind. but in the midst of the valleys the young ascanius glories in his fiery steed, galloping past now these, now those, and prays that amid the timorous herds a foaming boar may be granted to his vows or a tawny lion come down from the mountain. nl  meanwhile in the sky begins the turmoil of a wild uproar; rain follows, mingled with hail. the scattered tyrian train and the trojan youth, with the dardan grandson of venus, in their fear seek shelter here and there over the fields; torrents rush down from the heights. to the same cave come dido and the trojan chief. primal earth and nuptial juno give the sign; fires flashed in heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountaintop screamed the nymphs. that day the first of death, the first of calamity was cause. for no more is dido swayed by fair show or fair fame, no more does she dream of a secret love: she calls it marriage and with that name veils her sin. nl  at once rumour runs through libya’s great cities – rumour the swiftest of all evils. speed lends her strength, and she winds vigour as she goes; small at first through fear, soon she mounts up to heaven, and walks the ground with head hidden in the clouds. mother earth, provoked to anger against the gods, brought her forth last, they, say as sister to coeus and enceladus, swift of foot and fleet of wing, a monster awful and huge, who for the many feathers in her body has as many watchful eyes beneath – wondrous to tell – as many tongues, as many sounding mouths, as many pricked-up ears. by night, midway between heaven and earth, she flies through the gloom, screeching, and droops not her eyes in sweet sleep; by day she sits on guard on high rooftop or lofty turrets, and affrights great cities, clinging to the false and the wrong, yet heralding truth. now exulting in manifold gossip, she filled the nations and sang alike of fact and falsehood, how aeneas is come, one born of trojan blood, to whom in marriage fair dido deigns to join herself; now they while away the winter, all its length, in wanton ease together, heedless of their realms and enthralled by shameless passion. these tales the foul goddess spreads here and there upon the lips of men. straightway to king iarbas she bends her course, and with her words fires his spirit and heaps high his wrath. nl  he, the son of hammon by a ravished garamantian nymph, set up to jupiter in his broad realms a hundred vast temples, a hundred altars, and had hallowed the wakeful fire, the eternal sentry of the gods. the ground was fat with the blood of beasts and the portals bloomed with varied garlands. distraught in mind and fired with the bitter tale, they say, before the altars and amid the divine presences he often besought jove in prayer with upturned hands: “almighty jupiter, to whom now the moorish race, feasting on embroidered couches, pour a lenaean offering, do you see these things? is it vainly, father, that we shudder at you, when you hurl your thunderbolts? and do aimless fires amid the clouds terrify our souls and stir murmurs void of purpose? this woman who, straying in our bounds, set up a tiny city at a price, to whom we gave coastland to plough and terms of tenure, has spurned my offers of marriage, and welcomed aeneas into her realm as lord. and now that paris with his eunuch train, his chin and perfumed locks bound with a lydian turban, grasps the spoil; while we bring offerings to your temples, yours forsooth, and cherish an idle story.” nl  as with such words he pleaded, clasping the altars, the almighty gave ear and turned his eyes on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of their nobler fame. then thus to mercury he speaks and gives this charge: “go forth, my son, call the zephyrs, glide on they wings, and speak to the dardan chief, who now at carthage is looking forward to tyrian cities, unmindful of those granted him by the fates; so carry down my words through the swift winds. not such as this did his lovely mother promise him to us, nor for this twice rescue him from grecian arms; but he it was who should rule italy, a land teeming with empire and clamorous with war, hand on a race from teucer’s noble blood, and bring all the world beneath his laws. if the glory of such a fortune fires him not and for his own fame’s sake he shoulders not the burden, does he, the father, grudge ascanius the towers of rome? what is his plan? in what hope does he tarry among a hostile people and pays no heed to ausonia\s race and the lavinian fields? let him set sail; this is the sum; be this the message from me.” nl  he ceased. the god made ready to obey his mighty father’s bidding, and first binds on his feet the golden shoes which carry him upborne on wings over seas or land, swift as the gale. then he takes his wand; with this he calls pale ghosts from orcus and sends others down to gloomy tartaurs, gives or takes away sleep and unseals eyes in death; relying on this, he drives the winds and skims the stormy clouds. and now in flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling atlas, who props heaven on his peak – atlas, whose pine-wreathed head is ever girt with black clouds, and beaten with wind and rain; fallen snow mantles his shoulders while rivers plunge down the aged chin and his rough beard is stiff with ice. here, poised on even wings, the cyllenian first halted; hence with his whole frame he sped sheer down to the waves like a bird, which round the shores, round the fish-haunted cliffs, flies low near to the waters. even thus between earth and sky flew cyllene’s nursling to libya’s sandy shore, and cut the winds, coming from his mother’s sire. nl  as soon as with winged feet he reached the huts, he sees aeneas founding towers and building new houses. and his sword was starred with yellow jasper, and a cloak hung from his shoulders ablaze with tyrian purple – a gift that wealthy dido had wrought, interweaving the web with thread of gold. at once he assails him: “are you now laying the foundations of lofty carthage, and building up a fair city, and all for a woman’s whim? alas! with never a thought of your own realm and fate! the ruler of the gods himself, who sways heaven and earth with his power, sends me down to you from bright olympus. he himself bids me bring this charge through the swift breezes: what are you planning? in what hope do you waste idle hours in libyan lands? if the glory of such a fortune does not stir you, and for your own fame’s sake you do not shoulder the burden, have regard from growing ascanius, the promise of iulus your heir, to whom the kingdom of italy and the roman land are due.” such words the cyllenian spoke, and while yet speaking left the sight of men and far away from their eyes vanished into thin air. nl  but in truth aeneas, aghast at he sight, was struck dumb; his hair stood up in terror and the voice choked in his throat. he burns to flee away and quit that pleasant land, awed by that warning and divine commandment. ah, what to do? with what speech now dare he approach the frenzied queen? what opening words choose first? and as he casts his swift mind this way and that, takes it in different directions and considers every possibility, this, as he wavered, seemed the better counsel; he calls mnestheus and sergestus, bidding them make ready the fleet in silence, gather the crews to the shore, and order the armament, but hide the cause of his altered plans. he meanwhile, since gracious dido knows nothing, nor expects the breaking of so strong a love, will essay an approach and seek the happiest season for speech, the plan auspicious for his purpose. at once all gladly obey his command and do his bidding. nl  but the queen – who may deceive a lover? – divined his guile, and early caught news of the coming stir, fearful even when all was safe. the same heartless rumour brought her the maddening news that they are arming the fleet and making ready for sailing. helpless in mind she rages, and all aflame raves through the city, like some thyiad startled by the shaken emblems, when she has heard the bacchic cry: the biennial revels fire her and at night cithaeron summons her with its din. at length she thus accosts aeneas first: nl  “’false one! did you really hope to cloak so foul a crime, and to steal from my land in silence? does neither our love restrain you, nor the pledge once given, nor the doom of a cruel death for dido? even in the winter season do you actually hasten to labour at your fleet, and to journey over the sea in the midst of northern gales, heartless one? what! if you were not in quest of alien lands and homes unknown, were ancient troy yet standing, would troy be sought by your ships over stormy seas? is it from me you are fleeing? by these tears and your right hand, i pray you – since nothing else, alas, have i left myself – by the marriage that is ours, by the nuptial rites begun, if ever i deserved well of you, or if anything of mine has been sweet in your sight, pity a falling house, and if yet there be any room for prayers, put away, i pray, this purpose. because of you the libyan tribes and numidian chiefs hate me, the tyrians are my foes; because of you i have also lost my honour and that former fame by which alone i was winning a title to the stars. to whose mercy do you leave me on the point of death, guest – since that alone is left from the name of husband? why do i linger? is it till pygmalion, my brother, overthrow this city, or the gaetulian iarbas lead me captive? at least, if before your flight a child of yours had been born to me, if in my hall a baby aeneas were playing, whose face, in spite of all, would bring back yours, i should not think myself utterly vanquished and forlorn.” nl  she ceased: he by jove’s command held his eyes steadfast and with a struggle smothered the pain deep within his heart. at last he briefly replies: “i will never deny, queen, that you have deserved of me the utmost you can set forth in speech, nor shall my memory of elissa be bitter, while i have memory of myself, and while breath governs these limbs. for my conduct few words will i say. i did not hope – think not that – to veil my flight in stealth. i never held out a bridegroom’s torch or entered such a compact. had destiny permitted me to shape my life after my own pleasure and order my sorrows at my own will, my first care would be the city of troy and the sweet relics of my king. priam’s high house would still abide and my own hand would have set up a revived pergamus for the vanquished. but now of great italy has grynean apollo bidden me lay hold, of italy the lycian oracles. there is my love, there my country! if the towers of carthage and the sight of libyan city charm you, a phoenician, why, pray, grudge the trojans their settling on ausonian land? we, too, have the right to seek a foreign realm. each time the night with dewy shades veils the earth, each time the starry fires arise, in my dreams my father anchises’ troubled ghost brings me warning and terror; the thought of young ascanius comes to me and the wrong done to one so dear, whom i am cheating of a hesperian kingdom and predestined lands. now, too, the messenger of the gods sent from jove himself – i sear by both our lives – has borne his command down through the swift breezes; my own eyes saw the god in the clear light of day come within our walls and these ears drank in his words. cease to inflame yourself and me with your complaints. it is not by my wish that i make for italy . . . “ nl  as thus he spoke, all the while she gazes on him askance, turning her eyes to and fro, and with silent glances scans the whole man; then thus, inflamed, cries out: “false one, no goddess was your mother, nor was dardanus the founder of your line, but rugged caucasus on his flinty rocks begot you, and hyrcanian tigresses suckled you. for why hide my feelings? for what greater wrongs do i hold myself back? did he sigh while i wept? did he turn on me a glance? did he yield and shed tears or pity her who loved him? what shall i say first? what next? now, neither mighty juno nor the saturnian sire looks on these things with righteous eyes! nowhere is faith secure. i welcomed him, a castaway on the shore, a beggar, and madly gave him a share of my throne; his lost fleet i rescued, his crews i saved from death. alas! i am whirled on the fires of frenzy. now prophetic apollo, now the lycian oracles, now the messenger of the gods sent from jove himself, brings through the air this dread command. truly, this is work for gods, this is care to vex their peace! i detain you not; i dispute not your words. go, make for italy with the winds; seek your kingdom over the waves. yet i trust, if the righteous gods have any power, that on the rocks midway you will drain the cup of vengeance and often call on dido’s name. though far away, i will chase you with murky brands and, when chill death has severed soul and body, everywhere my shade shall haunt you. relentless one, you will repay! i shall hear, and the tale will reach me in the depths of the world below!” so saying, she breaks off her speech midway and flees in anguish from the light, turning away, tearing herself from his sight, and leaving him in fear and much hesitance, and ready to say much. her maids support her, carry her swooning form to her marble bower, and lay her on her bed. nl  but loyal aeneas, though longing to soothe and assuage her grief and by his words turn aside her sorrow, with many a sigh, his soul shaken by his mighty love, yet fulfils heaven’s bidding and returns to the fleet. then, indeed, the teucrians fall to and all along the shore launch their tall ships. the keels, well-pitched, are set afloat; the sailors, eager for flight, bring from the woods leafy boughs for oars and logs unhewn . . . one could see them moving away and streaming forth from all the city. even as when ants, mindful of winter, plunder a huge heap of corn and store it in their home; over the plain moves a black column, and through the grass they carry the spoil on a narrow track; some strain with their shoulders and heave on the huge grains, some close up the ranks and rebuke the delay; all the path is aglow with work. what feelings then were yours, dido, at such a sight! or what sighs did you utter, viewing from the top of the fortress the beach aglow far and near, and seeing before your eyes the whole sea astir with loud cries! o relentless love, to what do you not drive the heats of men. once more she must needs break into tears, once more assail him with prayer, and humbly bow down her pride to love, lest she leave anything untried and go to death in vain. nl  “anna, you see the bustle all along the shore; from all sides they have gathered; already the canvas invites the breeze, and the joyous sailors have crowned the stern with garlands. if i have had strength to foresee this great sorrow, i shall also, sister, have strength to endure it. yet this one service, anna, do for me – for you alone that traitor made his friend, to you he confided even his secret thoughts, you alone will know the hour for easy access to him – go, sister, and humbly address our haughty foe. i never conspired with the danaans at aulis to root out the trojan race; i never sent a fleet to pergamus, nor tore up the ashes and disturbed the spirit of his father anchises. why does he refuse to admit my words to his stubborn ears? whither does he hasten? this, the last boon, let him grant his poor lover: let him await an easy flight and favouring winds. no more do i plead for the old marriage tie which he forswore, nor that he give up fair latium and resign his realm: for empty time i ask, for peace and reprieve for my frenzy, till fortune teach my vanquished soul to grieve. this last grace i crave – pity your sister – which, when he has granted it, i will repay with full interest in my death.” nl  such was her prayer and such the tearful pleas the unhappy sister bears again and again. but by no tearful pleas is he moved, nor in yielding mood does he pay heed to any words. fate withstands and heaven seals his kindly, mortal ears. even as when northern alpine winds, blowing now hence, now thence, emulously strive to uproot an oak strong with the strength of years, there comes a roar, the trunk quivers and the high leafage thickly strews the ground, but the oak clings to the crag, and as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven, so far it strikes its roots down towards hell – even so with ceaseless appeals, from this side and from that, the hero is buffeted, and in his mighty heart feels agony: his mind stands steadfast; his tears fall without effect. nl  then, indeed, awed by her doom, luckless dido prays for death; she is weary of gazing on the arch of heaven. and to make her more surely fulfil her purpose and leave the light, she saw, as she laid her gifts on the altars ablaze with incense – fearful to tell – the holy water darken and the outpoured wine change into loathsome gore. of this sight she spoke to no one – not even her sister. moreover, there was in the palace a marble chapel to her former lord, which she cherished in wondrous honour, wreathing it with snowy fleeces and festal foliage. thence she heard, it seemed, sounds and speech as of her husband calling, whenever darkling night held the world; and alone on the housetops with ill-boding song the owl would oft complain, drawing out its lingering notes into a wail; and likewise many a saying of the seers of old terrifies her with fearful boding. in her sleep fierce aeneas himself drives her in her frenzy; and ever she seems to be left lonely, ever ending, companionless, an endless way, and seeking her tyrians in a land forlorn – even as raving pentheus sees the bacchants’ bands, and a double sun and two-fold thebes rise to view; or as when agamemnon’s son, orestes, hounded by the furies, flees from his mother, who is armed with brands and black serpents, while at the doorway crouch avenging fiends. nl  so when, outworn with anguish, she caught the madness and resolved to die, in her own heart she determines the time and manner, and accosts her sorrowful sister, with mien that veils her plan and on her brow a cloudless hope. “sister mine, i have found a way – wish your sister joy – to return him to me or release me from my love for him. near ocean’s bound and the setting sun lies ethiopia, farthest of lands, where mightiest atlas on this shoulders turns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars. thence a priestess of massylian race has been shown me, warden of the fane of the hesperides, who gave dainties to the dragon and guarded the sacred bows on the tree, sprinkling dewy honey and slumberous poppies. with her spells she professes to set free the hearts of whom she wills, but on others to bring cruel love pains; to stay the flow of rivers and turn back the stars; she awakes the ghosts of night; and you will see earth rumbling under your feet and ash trees coming down the mountains. i call heaven to witness and you, dear sister mine, and your dear life, that against my will i arm myself with magic arts! secretly raise up a pyre in the inner court under the sky, and heap up on it’s the arms that heartless one left hanging in my bower, and all his attire and the bridal bed that was my undoing. i want to destroy all memorials of the abhorred wretch, and the priestess to directs.” thus she speaks and is silent; pallor the while overspreads her face. yet anna thinks not that her sister veils her death under these strange rites; her mind dreams not of such frenzy nor does she fear anything worse than when sychaeus died. so she makes ready as bidden . . . nl  but the queen, when in the heart of her home the pyre rose heavenward, piled high with pine logs and hewn ilex, hangs the place with garlands and crowns it with funeral boughs. on top, upon the couch, she lays the dress he wore, the sword he left, and an image of him, knowing what was to come. round about stand altars, and with streaming hair the priestess calls in thunder tones on thrice a hundred gods, erebos and chaos, and threefold hecate, triple-faced maiden diana. waters, too, she had sprinkled feigned to be from the spring of avernus, and herbs were sought, cut by moonlight with brazen sickles, and juicy with milk of black venom; sought, too, was the love charm, torn from the brow of a colt at birth before the mother snatched it . . . she herself, with holy meal and holy hands, stood beside the altars, one for unsandalled and girdle loosened; soon to die, she calls on the gods and on the stars, witnesses of her doom; then she prays to whatever power, righteous and mindful, watches over lovers unequally allied. nl  it was night, and over the earth weary creatures were tasting the peace of slumber; the woods and wild seas had sunk to rest – the hour when stars roll midway in their gliding course, when all the land is still, and beasts and coloured birds, both those that far and near haut the limpid lakes, and those that dwell in the thorny thickets of the countryside, are couched in sleep beneath the silent night. they were soothing their cares, their hearts oblivious of sorrows. but not so the soul-racked phoenician queen; she never sinks into sleep, nor draws darkness into eyes or heart. her pangs redouble, and her love, swelling up, surges afresh, as she heaves with a mighty tide of passion. thus then she begins, and thus alone revolves her thoughts in her heart: “see, hwat am i do do? shall i once more make trial of my old wooers, only to be mocked, and shall i humbly sue for marriage with numidians, whom i have scorned so often as husbands? shall i then follow the ilian ships and the trojan’s uttermost commands? is it because they are thankful for aid once given, and gratitude for past kindness stands firm in their mindful hearts? but who – suppose that i wished it – will suffer me, or take on so hated on those haughty ships? ah! lost one, do you not yet understand nor perceive the treason of laomedon’s race? what then? shall i on my own accompany the exultant sailors in their flight? or, surrounded by all my tyrian band, shall i pursue, and shall i again drive seaward the men whom i could scarce tear from the sidonian city, and bid them unfurl their sails to the winds? nay, die as you deserve, and with the sword end your sorrow. won over by my tears, you, my sister, you were the first to load my frenzied soul with these ills, and drive me on the foe. ah, that i could not spend my life apart from wedlock, a blameless life, like some wild creature, and not know such cares! the faith vowed to the ashes of sychaeus i have not kept.” such were the cries that kept bursting from her heart. nl  but now that all was duly ordered, and now that he was resolved on going, aeneas was snatching sleep on his vessel’s high stern. in his sleep there appeared to him a vision of the god, as he came again with the same aspect, and once more seemed to warn him thus, in all aspects like mercury, in voice and colouring, in golden hair and the graceful limbs of youth: “goddess-born, when such hazard threatens, can you still slumber? do you not see the perils that from henceforth hem you in, madman? do you not hear the kindly breezes blowing? she, resolved on death, revolves in her heart fell craft and crime, and awakens the swirling surge of passion. will you not flee hence in haste, while hasty flight is possible? soon you will see the waters a welter of timbers, see fierce brands ablaze, and soon the shore flashing with flames, if dawn finds you lingering in these lands. up then, break off delay! a fickle and changeful thing is woman ever.” so he spoke and melted into the black night. nl  thus indeed aeneas, scared by the sudden vision, tears himself from sleep and bestirs his comrades. “make haste, my men, awake and man the benches! unfurl the sails with speed! a god sent from high heaven again spurs us to hasten our flight and cut the twisted cables. we follow you, holy among gods, whoever you are, and again joyfully obey your command. oh, be with us, give your gracious aid, and in the sky vouchsafe kindly stars!” he spoke, and from its sheath snatches his flashing sword and strikes the hawser with the drawn blade. the same zeal catches all at once; with hurry and scurry they have quitted the shore; the sea is hidden under their fleets; lustily they churn the foam and sweep the blue waters. nl  and now early dawn, leaving the saffron bed of tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth. soon as the queen from her watchtower saw the light whiten and the fleet move on with even sails, and knew the shores and harbours were void of oarsmen, thrice and four times she struck her comely breast with her hand, and tearing her golden hair, “o god,” she cries, “shall he go? shall the intruder have made of our realm a laughingstock? will pursuers not fetch arms and give chase from all the city, and some of them speed ships from the docks? go, haste to bring fire, serve arms, ply oars! what say i? where am i? what madness turns my brain? unhappy dido, do only now your sinful deeds come home to you? then was the time, when you gave your crown away. behold the pledge and promise of him who, so they say, carries wit him his ancestral gods and bore his worn-out father on his shoulders! could i not have seized him, torn him limb from limb, and scattered the pieces on the waves? could i not have put his men to the sword, and ascanius himself, and served him up as a meal at his father’s table? but perhaps the issue of battle had been doubtful? suppose it had been: doomed to death, whom had i to fear? i should have carried fire to his camp, filled his decks with flame, blotted out father and son together with the whole race, and immolated myself on top of all. o sun, whose rays survey all that is done on earth; and juno, agent and witness of unhappy love; hecate, whose name is wailed by night in city streets; and avenging furies and gods of dying elissa: hear me now; turn your anger upon the sins that merit it, and listen to my prayers! if that accursed wretch must needs reach harbour and come to shore, if jove’s ordinances so demand and this is the outcome fixed: yet even so, harassed in war by the arms of a fearless nation, expelled from his territory and torn from iulus’ embrace, let him plead for aid an see his friends cruelly slaughtered! nor yet, when he has submitted to the terms of an unjust peace, may he enjoy his kingship or the life he longs for, but perish before his time and lie unburied on a lonely strand! this is my prayer; this last utterance i pour out with my blood. then do you, tyrians, persecute with hate his stock and all the race to come, and to my dust offer this tribute! let no lover or treaty unite the nations! arise from my ashes, unknown avenger, to harass the trojan settlers with fire and sword – today, hereafter, whenever strength be ours! may coast with coast conflict, i pray, and sea with sea, arms with arms; war may they have, themselves and their children’s children!” nl  with this curse she turned her mind in every direction, seeking how most quickly to end the life she loathed. then briefly she addressed barce, the nurse of sychaeus, for the pyre’s black ashes held her own back in her country of long ago. “dear nurse, bring my sister anna here. bid her hasten to sprinkle her body with river water and bring with her the victims and offerings ordained for atonement. this done, let her come; and veil your brows, too, with a pure chaplet. i am minded to fulfil the rites of stygian jove that i have duly ordered and begun, to put an end to my owes, and give over to the flames the pyre of that dardan wretch.” she spoke; the nurse hastened her steps with an old woman’s zeal. but dido, trembling and frantic with her dreadful design, rolling bloodshot eyes, her quivering cheeks flecked with burning spots, and pale at the imminence of death, bursts into the inner courts of the house, climbs the high pyre in a frenzy and unsheathes the dardan sword, a gift south for no such purpose. then, as she saw the trojan garb and the familiar bed, pausing awhile in tearful thought, she threw herself on the couch and spoke her last words: “o relics once dear, while god and fate allowed, take my spirit, and release me from my woes! my life is done and i have finished the course that fortune gave; and now in majesty my shade shall pass beneath the earth. a noble city i have built; my own walls i have seen; avenging my husband, i have exacted punishment from my brother and foe – happy, too happy, had but the dardan keels never touched our shores!” she spoke, and burying her face in the couch, “i shall die unavenged,” she cries, “but let me die! thus, i go gladly into the dark! let the cruel dardan’s eyes drink in this fire from the deep, and carry with him the omen of my death!” nl  she ceased; and even as she spoke her handmaids see her fallen on the sword, the blade reeking with blood and her hands bespattered. a scream rises to the lofty roof; rumour riots through the stricken city. the palace rings with lamentation, with sobbing and women’s shrieks, and heaven echoes with loud wails – as though all carthage or ancient tyre were falling before the inrushing foe, and fierce flames were rolling on over the roofs of men, over the roofs of gods. nl  swooning, her sister heard, and in dismay rushed through the throng, tearing her face with her nails, and beating her breast with her fists, as she called on the dying woman by name. “was this your purpose, sister? did you aim your fraud at me? was this for me the meaning of your pyre, this the meaning of your altar and fires? forlorn, what shall i first lament? did you scorn in death your sister’s company? you should have summoned me to share your fate; the same sword stroke, the same moment would have taken us both! did these hands indeed build the pyre, and did my voice call on our father’s gods, in order that, when you were lying thus, i, cruel one, should be far away? you have destroyed yourself and me together, sister, the sidonian senate and people, and your city! bring me water to bathe her wounds and catch with my lips whatever last breath may linger!” thus speaking, she had climbed the high steps, and, throwing her arms round her dying sister, sobbed and clasped her to her bosom, stanching with her dress the dark streams of blood. she, trying to lift her heavy eyes, swoons again, and the deep-set wound gurgles in her breast. thrice rising, she struggles to prop herself on her elbow, thrice the bed rolled back, with wandering eyes sought high heaven’s light, and when she found it, moaned. nl  then almighty juno, pitying her long agony and painful dying, sent iris down from heaven to release her struggling soul from the prison of her flesh. for since she perished neither in the course of fate nor by a death she had earned, but wretchedly before her day, in the heat of sudden frenzy, not yet had propserpine taken from head the golden lock and consigned her to the stygian underworld. so iris on dewy saffron wings flits down through the sky, trailing athwart the sun a thousand shifting tints, and halted above her head. “this offering, sacred to dis, i take as bidden, and from your body set you free”: so she speaks and with her hand severs the lock; and therewith all the warmth passed away, and the life vanished into the winds."

37,Jhove,Bedtime Stories,"2217  time zone v (est) 7 nov. 1970-ntc- ""pop's place"": nl i was polishing a brandy snifter when the unmarried mother came in. i noted the time-10: 17 p. m. zone five, or  eastern  time, nl november  7th,  1970. temporal agents always notice time and date; we must. nl the unmarried mother was a man twenty–five years old, no taller than i am, childish features and a touchy temper. i didn’t like his looks—i never had—but he was a lad i was here to recruit, he was my boy. i gave him my best barkeep’s smile. nl maybe i'm too critical. he wasn't swish;  his  nickname nl came from what he always said when some nosy type asked him his nl line:  ""i'm  an  unmarried  mother.  --  if  he  felt less than nl murderous he  would  add:  ""at  four  cents  a  word.  i  write nl confession stories. -- nl if  he  felt  nasty, he would wait for somebody to make nl something of it. he had a lethal style of  infighting,  like  a nl female cop - reason i wanted him. not the only one. nl he  had a load on, and his face showed that he despised nl people more than usual. silently i poured a double shot of  old nl underwear and left the bottle. he drank it, poured another. nl i  wiped  the  bar top. -- how's the ""unmarried mother"" nl racket? -- nl his fingers tightened on the glass and he seemed  about nl to  throw  it  at  me;  i  felt  for  the sap under the bar. in nl temporal manipulation you try to figure everything,  but  there nl are so many factors that you never take needless risks. nl i  saw  him  relax  that  tiny amount they teach you to nl watch for in the bureau's training school. -- sorry, "" i  said. nl -- just  asking, ""how's business? "" make it ""how's the weather? nl -- nl he looked sour. -- business is okay. i write ""em,  they nl print ""em, i eat. -- nl i  poured  myself  one, leaned toward him. -- matter of nl fact, "" i said, ""you write a nice stick - i've sampled  a  few. nl you have an amazingly sure touch with the woman's angle. -- nl it  was  a  slip i had to risk; he never admitted what nl pen-names he used. but he was boiled enough to pick up only the nl last: ""'woman's angle! """" he repeated with a snort. -- yeah,  i nl know the woman's angle. i should. -- nl ""so? -- i said doubtfully. -- sisters? -- nl ""no. you wouldn't believe me if i told you. -- nl ""now,   now,  ""  i  answered  mildly,  ""bartenders  and nl psychiatrists learn that nothing is stranger than  truth.  why, nl son,  if  you  heard the stories i do-well, you'd make yourself nl rich. incredible. -- nl ""you don't know what ""incredible"" means! "" nl ""so? nothing astonishes me. i've always heard worse. -- nl he snorted again. -- want  to  bet  the  rest  of  the nl bottle? -- nl ""i'll bet a full bottle. -- i placed one on the bar. nl ""well-""  i  signaled  my  other bartender to handle the nl trade. we were at the far end, a single-stool space that i kept nl private by loading the bar top by it with jars of pickled  eggs nl and  other  clutter.  a  few were at the other end watching the nl fights and somebody was playing the juke box-private as  a  bed nl where we were. nl ""okay, "" he began, ""to start with, i'm a bastard. -- nl ""no distinction around here, "" i said. nl ""i  mean  it,  ""  he  snapped.  --  my  parents weren't nl married. -- nl ""still no distinction, "" i insisted.  --  neither  were nl mine. -- nl ""when-""  he stopped, gave me the first warm look i ever nl saw on him. — you mean that? — nl ""i do. a one-hundred-percent  bastard.  in  fact,  ""  i nl added, ""no one in my family ever marries. all bastards. nl ""oh, that. -- i showed it to him. — it just looks like nl a wedding  ring;  i  wear  it  to  keep  women off. — it is an nl antique i bought in 1985 from  a  fellow  operative  —  he  had nl fetched  it  from pre-christian crete. —  “the wormouroboros... the world snake that eats its own tail, forever without end. a symbol of the great paradox.” nl he barely glanced at it. -- if you're really a bastard, nl you know how it feels. when i was a little girl-"" nl ""wups!

you're trying to tell me-"" nl ""don't interrupt or swelp me, i won't  talk.  i  was  a nl foundling, left at an orphanage in cleveland in 1945 when i was nl a  month  old.  when  i  was  a little girl, i envied kids with nl parents. then, when i learned about sex-and, believe  me,  pop, nl you learn fast in an orphanage-"" nl ""i know "" nl ""-i  made  a solemn vow that any kid of mine would have nl both a pop and a mom. it kept me ""pure, "" quite a feat in  that nl vicinity  -  i  had  to learn to fight to manage it. then i got nl older and realized  i  stood  darn  little  chance  of  getting nl married  -  for  the  same  reason i hadn't been adopted --. he nl scowled. i was horse-faced and buck-toothed,  flat-chested  and nl straight-haired. nl ""you don't look any worse than i do. -- nl ""who cares how a barkeep looks? or a writer? but peaple nl wanting to  adopt  pick  little  blue-eyed golden-haired moron. nl later on, the boys want bulging breasts, a cute  face,  and  an nl oh-you-wonderful-male   manner.  --  he  shrugged.  i  couldn't nl compete. so i decided to join the w. e. n. c. h. e. s. -- nl eh? -- nl ""women's  emergency  national  corps,   hospitality   & nl entertainment    section,    what    they   now   call   ""space nl angels'-auxiliary nursing group, extraterrestrial legions. -- nl i knew both terms, once i had them  chronized.  we  use nl still  a  third  name,  it's that elite military service corps: nl women's hospitality order refortifying & encouraging  spacemen. nl vocabulary  shift  is  the worst hurdle in time-jumps - did you nl know  that  ""service  station""  once  fractions?  once  on   an nl assignment  in  the churchill era, a woman said to me, ""meet me nl at the service station next door -- -  which  is  not  what  it nl sounds; a service station"" (then) wouldn't have a bed in it. nl he  went on: ""it was when they first admitted you can't nl send men into space for months and years and  not  relieve  the nl tension. you remember how the wowsers screamed? - that improved nl my  chance,  since  volunteers  were  scarce.  a  gal had to be nl respectable, preferably virgin (they liked to train  them  from nl scratch),  above  average mentally, and stable emotionally. but nl most volunteers were old hookers, or neurotics who would  crack nl up ten days off earth. so i didn't need looks; if they accepted nl me,  they would fix my buck teeth, put a wave in my hair, teach nl me to walk and dance and how to listen to a man pleasingly, and nl everything else - plus training  for  the  prime  duties.  they nl would  even  use plastic surgery if it would help - nothing too nl good for our boys. nl ""best yet, they  made  sure  you  didn't  get  pregnant nl during  your  enlistment - and you were almost certain to marry nl at the end of your hitch. same way today, a. n.  g.  e.  l.  s. nl marry spacers - they talk the language. nl ""when  i  was  eighteen  i  was  placed  as a `mother's nl helper'. this family simply  wanted  a  cheap  servant,  but  i nl didn't  mind  as i couldn't enlist till i was twenty-one. i did nl housework and went to night school - pretending to continue  my nl high  school  typing  and  shorthand but going to a charm class nl instead, to better my chances for enlistment. nl “then i met this city slicker with his hundred–dollar bills.” he scowled. “the no–good actually did have a wad of hundred–dollar bills. he showed me one night, told me to help myself.“but i didn’t. i liked him. he was the first man i ever met who was nice to me without trying games with me. iquit night school to see him oftener. it was the happiest time of my life.“then one night in the park the games began.”he stopped. i said, “and then?”“and then nothing! i never saw him again. he walked me home and told me he loved me—and kissed me good—night and never came back.” he looked grim. “ if i could find him, i’d kill him!”“well,” i sympathized, “i know how you feel. but killing him—just for doing what comes naturally—hmm...did you struggle?”“huh? what’s that got to do with it?”“quite a bit. maybe he deserves a couple of broken arms for running out on you, but—”“he deserves worse than that! wait till you hear. somehow i kept anyone from suspecting and decided it wasall for the best. i hadn’t really loved him and probably would never love anybody—and i was more eager tojoin the w.e.n.c.h.e.s. than ever. i wasn’t disqualified, they didn’t insist on virgins. i cheered up.“it wasn’t until my skirts got tight that i realized.”“pregnant?”“he had me higher ’n a kite! those skinflints i lived with ignored it as long as i could work—then kicked meout, and the orphanage wouldn’t take me back. i landed in a charity ward surrounded by other big bellies andtrotted bedpans until my time came.“one night i found myself on an operating table, with a nurse saying, ‘relax. now breathe deeply. nl “i woke up in bed, numb from the chest down. my surgeon came in. ‘how do you feel?’ he says cheerfully.“ ‘like a mummy.’“‘naturally. you’re wrapped like one and full of dope to keep you numb. you’ll get well—but a cesareanisn’t a hangnail.’“‘cesarean’ i said. ‘doc—did i lose the baby?’“‘oh, no. your baby’s fine.’“oh. boy or girl?“‘a healthy little girl. five pounds, three ounces.’“i relaxed. it’s something, to have made a baby. i told myself i would go somewhere and tack ‘mrs.’ on myname and let the kid think her papa was dead—no orphanage for my kid!“but the surgeon was talking. ‘tell me, uh—’ he avoided my name. ‘did you ever think your glandular setupwas odd?’“i said, ‘huh? of course not. what are you driving at?’“he hesitated. ‘i’ll give you this in one dose, then a hypo to let you sleep off your jitters. you’ll have ’em.’“‘why?’ i demanded.“‘ever hear of that scottish physician who was female until she was thirty five? —then had surgery andbecame legally and medically a man? got married. all okay.’“‘what’s that got to do with me?’“‘that’s what i’m saying. you’re a man.’“i tried to sit up. ‘what?’“‘take it easy. when i opened you, i found a mess. i sent for the chief of surgery while i got the baby out,then we held a consultation with you on the table—and worked for hours to salvage what we could. you hadtwo full sets of organs, both immature, but with the female set well enough developed for you to have a baby.they could never be any use to you again, so we took them out and rearranged things so that you can developproperly as a man.’ he put a hand on me. ‘don’t worry. you’re young, your bones will readjust, we’ll watchyour glandular balance—and make a fine young man out of you.’“i started to cry. ‘what about my baby?’“‘well, you can’t nurse her, you haven’t milk enough for a kitten. if i were you, i wouldn’t see her—put herup for adoption.’“‘no!’“he shrugged. ‘the choice is yours; you’re her mother—well, her parent. but don’t worry now; we’ll get youwell first.’“next day they let me see the kid and i saw her daily—trying to get used to her. i had never seen a nl brand–new baby and had no idea how awful they look—my daughter looked like an orange monkey. myfeelings changed to cold determination to do right by her. but four weeks later that didn’t mean anything.”“eh?”“she was snatched.”“‘snatched?’”the unmarried mother almost knocked over the bottle we had bet. “kidnapped—stolen from the hospitalnursery!” he breathed hard. “how’s that for taking the last a man’s got to live for?”“a bad deal,” i agreed. “let’s pour you another. no clues?”“nothing the police could trace. somebody came to see her, claimed to be her uncle. while the nurse had herback turned, he walked out with her.”“description?”“just a man, with a face–shaped face, like yours or mine.” he frowned. “i think it was the baby’s father. thenurse swore it was an older man but he probably used makeup. who else would swipe my baby? childlesswomen pull such stunts—but whoever heard of a man doing it?”“what happened to you then?”“eleven more months of that grim place and three operations. in four months i started to grow a beard; beforei was out i was shaving regularly... and no longer doubted that i was male.” he grinned wryly. “i was staringdown nurses necklines.”“well,” i said, “seems to me you came through okay. here you are, a normal man, making good money, noreal troubles. and the life of a female is not an easy one.”he glared at me. “a lot you know about it!”“so?”“ever hear the expression ‘a ruined woman’?”“mmm, years ago. doesn’t mean much today.”“i was as ruined as a woman can be; that bum really ruined me—i was no longer a woman... and i didn’tknow how to be a man.”“takes getting used to, i suppose.”“you have no idea. i don’t mean learning how to dress, or not walking into the wrong rest room; i learnedthose in the hospital. but how could i live? what job could i get? hell, i couldn’t even drive a car. i didn’tknow a trade; i couldn’t do manual labor—too much scar tissue, too tender.“i hated him for having ruined me for the w.e.n.c.h.e.s., too, but i didn’t know how much until i tried tojoin the space corps instead. one look at my belly and i was marked unfit for military service. the medicalofficer spent time on me just from curiosity; he had read about my case.“so i changed my name and came to new york. i got by as a fry cook, then rented a typewriter and set nl myself up as a public stenographer—what a laugh! in four months i typed four letters and one manuscript.the manuscript was for real life tales and a waste of paper, but the goof who wrote it sold it.“which gave me an idea; i bought a stack of confession magazines and studied them.” he looked cynical.“now you know how i get the authentic woman’s angle on an unmarried–mother story... through the onlyversion i haven’t sold—the true one. do i win the bottle?”i pushed it toward him. i was upset myself, but there was work to do. i said, “son, you still want to lay handson that so–and–so?”his eyes lighted up—a feral gleam.“hold it!” i said. “you wouldn’t kill him?”he chuckled nastily. “try me.”“take it easy. i know more about it than you think i do. i can help you. i know where he is.”he reached across the bar. “where is he?”i said softly, “let go my shirt, sonny—or you’ll land in the alley and we’ll tell the cops you fainted.” i showedhim the sap.he let go. “sorry. but where is he?” he looked at me. “and how do you know so much?”“all in good time. there are records—hospital records, orphanage records, medical records. the matron ofyour orphanage was mrs. fetherage—right? she was followed by mrs. gruenstein—right? your name, as agirl, was ‘jane’—right? and you didn’t tell me any of this—right?”i had him baffled and a bit scared. “what’s this? you trying to make trouble for me?”“no indeed. i’ve your welfare at heart. i can put this character in your lap. you do to him as you see fit—andi guarantee that you’ll get away with it. but i don’t think you’ll kill him. you’d be nuts to—and you aren’tnuts. not quite.”he brushed it aside. “cut the noise. where is he?” i poured him a short one; he was drunk, but anger wasoffsetting it. “not so fast. i do something for you—you do something for me.”“uh... what?”“you don’t like your work. what would you say to high pay, steady work, unlimited expense account, yourown boss on the job, and lots of variety and adventure?”he stared. “i’d say, ‘get those goddam reindeer off my roof!’ shove it, pop—there’s no such job.”“okay, put it this way: i hand him to you, you settle with him, then try my job. if it’s not all i claim—well, ican’t hold you.”he was wavering; the last drink did it. “when d’yuh d’liver ’im?” he said thickly.he shoved out his hand. “it’s a deal!”“if it’s a deal—right now!” nl i nodded to my assistant to watch both ends, noted the time—2300—started to duck through the gate underthe bar—when the juke box blared out: “i’m my own grandpaw!” the service man had orders to load it withamericana and classics because i couldn’t stomach the ‘music’ of 1970, but i hadn’t known that tape was init. i called out, “shut that off! give the customer his money back.” i added, “storeroom, back in a moment,”and headed there with my unmarried mother following.it was down the passage across from the johns, a steel door to which no one but my day manager and myselfhad a key; inside was a door to an inner room to which only i had a key. we went there.he looked blearily around at windowless walls. “ where is he?”“right away.” i opened a case, the only thing in the room; it was a u. s. f. f. coordinates transformer fieldkit, series 1992, mod. ii—a beauty, no moving parts, weight twenty–three kilos fully charged, and shaped topass as a suitcase. i had adjusted it precisely earlier that day; all i had to do was to shake out the metal netwhich limits the transformation field.which i did. “what’s that?” he demanded.“time machine,” i said and tossed the net over us.“hey!” he yelled and stepped back. there is a technique to this; the net has to be thrown so that the subjectwill instinctively step back onto the metal mesh, then you close the net with both of you insidecompletely—else you might leave shoe soles behind or a piece of foot, or scoop up a slice of floor. but that’sall the skill it takes. some agents con a subject into the net; i tell the truth and use that instant of utterastonishment to flip the switch. which i did.1030–vi–3 april 1963—cleveland, ohio–apex bldg.: “hey!” he repeated. “take this damn thing off!”“sorry”, i apologized and did so, stuffed the net into the case, closed it. “you said you wanted to find him.”“but—you said that was a time machine!”i pointed out a window. “does that look like november? or new york?” while he was gawking at new budsand spring weather, i reopened the case, took out a packet of hundred–dollar bills, checked that the numbersand signatures were compatible with 1963. the temporal bureau doesn’t care how much you spend (it costsnothing) but they don’t like unnecessary anachronisms. too many mistakes, and a general court–martial willexile you for a year in a nasty period, say 1974 with its strict rationing and forced labor. i never make such mistakes; the money was okay.he turned around and said, “what happened?”“he’s here. go outside and take him. here’s expense money.” i shoved it at him and added, “settle him, theni’ll pick you up.”hundred–dollar bills have a hypnotic effect on a person not used to them. he was thumbing them unbelievingly as i eased him into the hall, locked him out. the next jump was easy, a small shift in era.7100–vi–10 march 1964—cleveland–apex bldg.: there was a notice under the door saying that my lease expired next week; otherwise the room looked as it had a moment before. outside, trees were bare and snowthreatened; i hurried, stopping only for contemporary money and a coat, hat, and topcoat i had left therewhen i leased the room. i hired a car, went to the hospital. it took twenty minutes to bore the nurseryattendant to the point where i could swipe the baby without being noticed. we went back to the apexbuilding. this dial setting was more involved, as the building did not yet exist in 1945. but i had precalculated nl it. 0100–vi–20 sept. 1945—cleveland–skyview motel: field kit, baby, and i arrived in a motel outside town.earlier i had registered as “gregory johnson, warren, ohio,” so we arrived in a room with curtains closed,windows locked, and doors bolted, and the floor cleared to allow for waver as the machine hunts. you can geta nasty bruise from a chair where it shouldn’t be—not the chair, of course, but backlash from the field.no trouble. jane was sleeping soundly; i carried her out, put her in a grocery box on the seat of a car i hadprovided earlier, drove to the orphanage, put her on the steps, drove two blocks to a ‘service station’ (thepetroleum–products sort) and phoned the orphanage, drove back in time to see them taking the box inside,kept going and abandoned the car near the motel—walked to it and jumped forward to the apex building in1963.2200–vi–24 april 1963—cleveland–apex bldg.: i had cut the time rather fine—temporal accuracydepends on span, except on return to zero. if i had it right, jane was discovering, out in the park this balmyspring night, that she wasn’t quite as nice a girl as she had thought. i grabbed a taxi to the home of thoseskinflints, had the hackie wait around a comer while i lurked in shadows.presently i spotted them down the street, arms around each other. he took her up on the porch and made along job of kissing her good–night—longer than i thought. then she went in and he came down the walk,turned away. i slid into step and hooked an arm in his. “that’s all, son,” i announced quietly. “i’m back topick you up.”“you!” he gasped and caught his breath.“me. now you know who he is—and after you think it over you’ll know who you are... and if you think hardenough, you’ll figure out who the baby is... and who i am.”he didn’t answer, he was badly shaken. it’s a shock to have it proved to you that you can’t resist seducingyourself. i took him to the apex building and we jumped again.2300–viii, 12 aug. 1985–sub rockies base: i woke the duty sergeant, showed my i. d., told the sergeant tobed my companion down with a happy pill and recruit him in the morning. the sergeant looked sour, but rankis rank, regardless of era; he did what i said—thinking, no doubt, that the next time we met he might be thecolonel and i the sergeant. which can happen in our corps. “what name?” he asked.i wrote it out. he raised his eyebrows. “like so, eh? hmm—”“you just do your job, sergeant.” i turned to my companion.“son, your troubles are over. you’re about to start the best job a man ever held—and you’ll do well. i know.”“that you will!” agreed the sergeant. “look at me—born in 1917—still around, still young, still enjoying life.”i went back to the jump room, set everything on preselected zero.2301–v–7 nov. 1970–nyc—“pop’s place”: i came out of the storeroom carrying a fifth of drambuie toaccount for the minute i had been gone. my assistant was arguing with the customer who had been playing“i’m my own grand–paw!” i said, “oh, let him play it, then unplug it.” i was very tired.it’s rough, but somebody must do it, and it’s very hard to recruit anyone in the later years, since the mistakeof 1972. can you think of a better source than to pick people all fouled up where they are and give themwell–paid, interesting (even though dangerous) work in a necessary cause? everybody knows now why thefizzle war of 1963 fizzled. the bomb with new york’s number on it didn’t go off, a hundred other things nl didn’t go as planned—all arranged by the likes of me.but not the mistake of ’72; that one is not our fault—and can’t be undone; there’s no paradox to resolve. athing either is, or it isn’t, now and forever amen. but there won’t be another like it; an order dated ‘1992’takes precedence any year.i closed five minutes early, leaving a letter in the cash register telling my day manager that i was accepting hisoffer to buy me out, to see my lawyer as i was leaving on a long vacation. the bureau might or might not pickup his payments, but they want things left tidy. i went to the room in the back of the storeroom and forward to 1993.2200–vii– 12 jan 1993–sub rockies annex–hq temporal dol: i checked in with the duty officer and went to my quarters, intending to sleep for a week. i had fetched the bottle we bet (after all, i won it) and tooka drink before i wrote my report. it tasted foul, and i wondered why i had ever liked old underwear. but itwas better than nothing; i don’t like to be cold sober, i think too much. but i don’t really hit the bottle either;other people have snakes—i have people.i dictated my report; forty recruitments all okayed by the psych bureau—counting my own, which i knewwould be okayed. i was here, wasn’t i? then i taped a request for assignment to operations; i was sick ofrecruiting. i dropped both in the slot and headed for bed. my eye fell on ‘the by–laws of time,’ over mybed:never do yesterday what should be done tomorrow.if at last you do succeed, never try again.a stitch in time saves nine billion.a paradox may be paradoctored.it is earlier when you think.ancestors are just people.even jove nods.they didn’t inspire me the way they had when i was a recruit; thirty subjective–years of time–jumping wearsyou down. i undressed, and when i got down to the hide i looked at my belly. a cesarean leaves a big scar,but i’m so hairy now that i don’t notice it unless i look for it.then i glanced at the ring on my finger. the snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever. i know where i came from—but where did all you zombies come from? i felt a headache coming on, but a headache powder is one thing i do not take. i did once—and you all wentaway.so i crawled into bed and whistled out the light.you aren’t really there at all. there isn’t anybody but me—jane—here alone in the dark.i miss you dreadfully!"

41,jives,waiting,(there's nothing in the world like a good friend) nl (there's nothing in the world like a good friend)
42,rocomoco,After the Darkness,"mrs. assingham and the colonel, quitting fawns before the end of september, had come back later on; and now, a couple of weeks after, they were again interrupting their stay, but this time with the question of their return left to depend, on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named. the lutches and mrs. rance had also, by the action of charlotte stant's arrival, ceased to linger, though with hopes and theories, as to some promptitude of renewal, of which the lively expression, awakening the echoes of the great stone-paved, oak-panelled, galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place, seemed still a property of the air. it was on this admirable spot that, before her october afternoon had waned, fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husband's final secession, at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations. the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine, a wonderful, windless, waiting, golden hour, under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the post-box with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters. they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out half-an-hour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought, later on, as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways. he traced his impression, on coming to consider, back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant. she simply ""cleared them out""—those had been the three words, thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in, the ""halcyon"" days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlotte's arrival. for it was during these days that mrs. rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure, and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair—the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence, and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap. this was what had occurred, that their lesson had been learned; and what mrs. assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half. it would certainly not have been taught by mrs. rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable. charlotte's light intervention had thus become a cause, operating covertly but none the less actively, and fanny assingham's speech, which she had followed up a little, echoed within him, fairly to startle him, as the indication of something irresistible. he could see now how this superior force had worked, and he fairly liked to recover the sight—little harm as he dreamed of doing, little ill as he dreamed of wishing, the three ladies, whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days. she had been so vague and quiet about it, wonderful charlotte, that he hadn't known what was happening—happening, that is, as a result of her influence. ""their fires, as they felt her, turned to smoke,"" mrs. assingham remarked; which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled. he had retained, since his long talk with maggie—the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend—an odd little taste, as he would have described it, for hearing things said about this young woman, hearing, so to speak, what could be said about her: almost as it her portrait, by some eminent hand, were going on, so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches. mrs. assingham, it struck him, applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend—so different a figure now from that early playmate of maggie's as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldn't make too much noise nor eat too much jam. his companion professed that in the light of charlotte's prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors. ""i felt in fact, privately, so sorry for them, that i kept my impression to myself while they were here—wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent; neither maggie, nor the prince, nor yourself, nor even charlotte herself, if you didn't happen to notice. since you didn't, apparently, i perhaps now strike you as extravagant. but i'm not—i followed it all. one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things, very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family. my comparison's only a little awkward, for i don't in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup. she was just herself their poison, in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them—but she didn't know it."" nl ""ah, she didn't know it?"" mr. verver had asked with interest. nl ""well, i think she didn't""—mrs. assingham had to admit that she hadn't pressingly sounded her. ""i don't pretend to be sure, in every connection, of what charlotte knows. she doesn't, certainly, like to make people suffer—not, in general, as is the case with so many of us, even other women: she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her. she likes, that is—as all pleasant people do—to be liked."" nl ""ah, she likes to be liked?"" her companion had gone on. nl ""she did, at the same time, no doubt, want to help us—to put us at our ease. that is she wanted to put you—and to put maggie about you. so far as that went she had a plan. but it was only after—it was not before, i really believe—that she saw how effectively she could work."" nl again, as mr. verver felt, he must have taken it up. ""ah, she wanted to help us?—wanted to help me?"" nl ""why,"" mrs. assingham asked after an instant, ""should it surprise you?"" nl he just thought. ""oh, it doesn't!"" nl ""she saw, of course, as soon as she came, with her quickness, where we all were. she didn't need each of us to go, by appointment, to her room at night, or take her out into the fields, for our palpitating tale. no doubt even she was rather impatient."" nl ""of the poor things?"" mr. verver had here inquired while he waited. nl ""well, of your not yourselves being so—and of your not in particular. i haven't the least doubt in the world, par exemple, that she thinks you too meek."" nl ""oh, she thinks me too meek?"" nl ""and she had been sent for, on the very face of it, to work right in. all she had to do, after all, was to be nice to you."" nl ""to—a—me?"" said adam verver. nl he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone. ""to you and to every one. she had only to be what she is—and to be it all round. if she's charming, how can she help it? so it was, and so only, that she 'acted'-as the borgia wine used to act. one saw it come over them—the extent to which, in her particular way, a woman, a woman other, and so other, than themselves, could be charming. one saw them understand and exchange looks, then one saw them lose heart and decide to move. for what they had to take home was that it's she who's the real thing."" nl ""ah, it's she who's the real thing?"" as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs. rance, so, doubtless, he had now, a little, appeared to offer submission in his appeal. ""i see, i see""—he could at least simply take it home now; yet as not without wanting, at the same time, to be sure of what the real thing was. ""and what would it be—a—definitely that you understand by that?"" nl she had only for an instant not found it easy to say. ""why, exactly what those women themselves want to be, and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will."" nl ""oh—of course never?"" nl it not only remained and abode with them, it positively developed and deepened, after this talk, that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished, socially speaking, with the thing classed and stamped as ""real""—just as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughter's marriage. the note of reality, in so much projected light, continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great ""finds""—continued, beyond any other, to keep him attentive and gratified. nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer, had we time to look into it, than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets, say, and new human acquisitions; all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling, on his own side, that he was, as a taster of life, economically constructed. he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips, and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket, like a tool of his trade, this receptacle, a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost, and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty. as it had served him to satisfy himself, so to speak, both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughter's betrothal, so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind, to which a provoking legend was attached, and as to which he had made out, contentedly, that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr. gutermann-seuss of brighton. it was all, at bottom, in him, the aesthetic principle, planted where it could burn with a cold, still flame; where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved, on the idea (followed by appropriation) of plastic beauty, of the thing visibly perfect in its kind; where, in short, in spite of the general tendency of the ""devouring element"" to spread, the rest of his spiritual furniture, modest, scattered, and tended with unconscious care, escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keeping-up of profane altar-fires. adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses, to the end of his own little book, without having, for a day, raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large; being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors, or other gentlemen of pleasure, who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper, occupied and competent below-stairs, never feels obliged to give warning. nl that figure has, however, a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands, though we may retain it for its rough negative value. it was to come to pass, by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within, that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend; amerigo and maggie having, with a certain abruptness, invited his assent to their going abroad for a month, since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security. an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince; his life, as for some time established, was deliciously dull, and thereby, on the whole, what he best liked; but a small gust of yearning had swept over him, and maggie repeated to her father, with infinite admiration, the pretty terms in which, after it had lasted a little, he had described to her this experience. he called it a ""serenade,"" a low music that, outside one of the windows of the sleeping house, disturbed his rest at night. timid as it was, and plaintive, he yet couldn't close his eyes for it, and when finally, rising on tiptoe, he had looked out, he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin, all duskily draped in her grace, the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever-to-be-loved italy. sooner or later, that way, one had to listen; it was a hovering, haunting ghost, as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong, a dim, pathetic shade crying out to be comforted. for this there was obviously but one way—as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome. they would accordingly—hadn't they better?—go for a little; maggie meanwhile making the too-absurdly artful point with her father, so that he repeated it, in his amusement, to charlotte stant, to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks, that it was absolutely, when she came to think, the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her. ""she doesn't count of course his having asked of her to marry him""— this was mr. verver's indulgent criticism; but he found charlotte, equally touched by the ingenuous maggie, in easy agreement with him over the question. if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year, this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not, in a beautiful fit of homesickness, revisit, without reproach, his native country. nl what his father-in-law frankly counselled was that the reasonable, the really too reasonable, pair should, while they were about it, take three or four weeks of paris as well—paris being always, for mr. verver, in any stress of sympathy, a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips. if they would only do that, on their way back, or however they preferred it, charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look—though even then, assuredly, as he had it at heart to add, not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together. the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled, for the moment, under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie, who—having, as she granted, to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother, and ""electing"" for the former—wanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants. her question had fairly resounded, but it had afterwards, like many of her questions, dropped still more effectively than it had risen: the highest moral of the matter being, before the couple took their departure, that mrs. noble and dr. brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib. if she hadn't supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse, whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows, just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains—if she hadn't been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her. in the same manner, if the sweetest—for it was so she qualified him—of little country doctors hadn't proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible, especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls, adapted to all weathers, that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences, over what he had found to answer with his little five at home, she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend. these persons, accordingly, her own predominance having thus, for the time, given way, could carry with a certain ease, and above all with mutual aid, their consciousness of a charge. so far as their office weighed they could help each other with it—which was in fact to become, as mrs. noble herself loomed larger for them, not a little of a relief and a diversion. nl mr. verver met his young friend, at certain hours, in the day-nursery, very much as he had regularly met the child's fond mother—charlotte having, as she clearly considered, given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write. she wrote with high fidelity, she let her companion know, and the effect of it was, remarkably enough, that he himself didn't write. the reason of this was partly that charlotte ""told all about him""—which she also let him know she did—and partly that he enjoyed feeling, as a consequence, that he was generally, quite systematically, eased and, as they said, ""done"" for. committed, as it were, to this charming and clever young woman, who, by becoming for him a domestic resource, had become for him practically a new person—and committed, especially, in his own house, which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thing—he took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him, could perhaps even lead him, and in thus putting to the test, for pleasant verification, what fanny assingham had said, at the last, about the difference such a girl could make. she was really making one now, in their simplified existence, and a very considerable one, though there was no one to compare her with, as there had been, so usefully, for fanny—no mrs. rance, no kitty, no dotty lutch, to help her to be felt, according to fanny's diagnosis, as real. she was real, decidedly, from other causes, and mr. verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs. assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it. she was directly and immediately real, real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale, and at no moments more so than during those—at which we have just glanced—when mrs. noble made them both together feel that she, she alone, in the absence of the queen-mother, was regent of the realm and governess of the heir. treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal court-functionaries, picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state, which began and ended with the nursery, they could only retire, in quickened sociability, to what was left them of the palace, there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate, in regard to the true executive, such snuff-taking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lap-dogs. nl every evening, after dinner, charlotte stant played to him; seated at the piano and requiring no music, she went through his ""favourite things""—and he had many favourites—with a facility that never failed, or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice. she could play anything, she could play everything—always shockingly, she of course insisted, but always, by his own vague measure, very much as if she might, slim, sinuous and strong, and with practised passion, have been playing lawn-tennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing. his love of music, unlike his other loves, owned to vaguenesses, but while, on his comparatively shaded sofa, and smoking, smoking, always smoking, in the great fawns drawing-room as everywhere, the cigars of his youth, rank with associations—while, i say, he so listened to charlotte's piano, where the score was ever absent but, between the lighted candles, the picture distinct, the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet, a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest. it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation, but the air, at the end, none the less, before they separated, had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk. they separated, in the hushed house, not quite easily, yet not quite awkwardly either, with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces, and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night. nl late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october, there had been a full word or two dropped into the still-stirring sea of other voices—a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment, and rather oddly, as louder and rounder than any previous sound; and then he had lingered, under pretext of an opened window to be made secure, after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase. he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed; picking up a hat in the hall, slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar, he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawing-room windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars. it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham, and the sense of that other hour, the sense of the suggestive woman herself, was before him again as, in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at, it had not yet been. he thought, in a loose, an almost agitated order, of many things; the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep. he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him; some light, some idea, some mere happy word perhaps, that he had begun to want, but had been till now, and especially the last day or two, vainly groping for. ""can you really then come if we start early?""—that was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light. and ""why in the world not, when i've nothing else to do, and should, besides, so immensely like it?""—this had as definitely been, on her side, the limit of the little scene. there had in fact been nothing to call a scene, even of the littlest, at all—though he perhaps didn't quite know why something like the menace of one hadn't proceeded from her stopping half-way upstairs to turn and say, as she looked down on him, that she promised to content herself, for their journey, with a toothbrush and a sponge. there hovered about him, at all events, while he walked, appearances already familiar, as well as two or three that were new, and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him, as we have noted, one of the minor yet so far as there were any such, quite one of the compensatory, incidents of being a father-in-law. it had struck him, up to now, that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo, as through some hereditary privilege, alone possessed the secret; so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte, who had unmistakably acquired it, through the young man's having amiably passed it on. she made use, for her so quietly grateful host, however this might be, of quite the same shades of attention and recognition, was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated, the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance. that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him, and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition, training, tact, or whatever else one might call it. it might almost have been—if such a link between them was to be imagined—that amerigo had, a little, ""coached"" or incited their young friend, or perhaps rather that she had simply, as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her, profited by observing, during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers, the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system. he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him like—from what noble and propagated convention, in cases in which the exquisite ""importance"" was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied, they had taken their specific lesson; but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never know—couldn't know without having been one's self a personage; whether a pope, a king, a president, a peer, a general, or just a beautiful author. nl before such a question, as before several others when they recurred, he would come to a pause, leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion. he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view, and this was exactly what made him reach out, in his unrest, for some idea, lurking in the vast freshness of the night, at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion, and so, spreading beneath him, make him feel that he floated. what he kept finding himself return to, disturbingly enough, was the reflection, deeper than anything else, that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon, or at the best signally relegate, his daughter. he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost her—as was indeed inevitable—by her own marriage; he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury, or at the best an inconvenience, that required some makeweight and deserved some amends. and he should do this the more, which was the great point, that he should appear to adopt, in doing it, the sentiment, in fact the very conviction, entertained, and quite sufficiently expressed, by maggie herself, in her beautiful generosity, as to what he had suffered—putting it with extravagance—at her hands. if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere, for it came—which she put with extravagance too—from her persistence, always, in thinking, feeling, talking about him, as young. he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus, in her absolutely unforced compunction, one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it. she had sacrificed a parent, the pearl of parents, no older than herself: it wouldn't so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age. that he wasn't, that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary, this was what added to her act the long train of its effect. light broke for him at last, indeed, quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden. as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue, which opened out so wide, for the minute, that he held his breath with wonder. he was afterwards to recall how, just then, the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place, everything round him, the wide terrace where he stood, the others, with their steps, below, the gardens, the park, the lake, the circling woods, lay there as under some strange midnight sun. it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery, a world that looked, so lighted, extraordinarily new, and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that, as if it had been a loud, a spoken pretension to beauty, interest, importance, to he scarce knew what, gave them an inordinate quantity of character and, verily, an inordinate size. this hallucination, or whatever he might have called it, was brief, but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping. the gasp of admiration had by this time, however, lost itself in an intensity that quickly followed—the way the wonder of it, since wonder was in question, truly had been the strange delay of his vision. he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond. it had sat all the while at his hearth-stone, whence it now gazed up in his face. nl once he had recognised it there everything became coherent. the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him, as a father, would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him. and it not only wouldn't be decently humane, decently possible, not to make this relief easy to her—the idea shone upon him, more than that, as exciting, inspiring, uplifting. it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible; it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met. the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace, and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his future—that is for hers—by marriage, by a marriage as good, speaking proportionately, as hers had been. as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations. he had seen that charlotte could contribute—what he hadn't seen was what she could contribute to. when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friend's leisure, the cool darkness had again closed round him, but his moral lucidity was constituted. it wasn't only moreover that the word, with a click, so fitted the riddle, but that the riddle, in such perfection, fitted the word. he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy. oh, if charlotte didn't accept him, of course the remedy would fail; but, as everything had fallen together, it was at least there to be tried. and success would be great—that was his last throb—if the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity. he really didn't know when in his life he had thought of anything happier. to think of it merely for himself would have been, even as he had just lately felt, even doing all justice to that condition—yes, impossible. but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child."

for my veins, nl treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them, nl my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is nl hardly different from myself, nl on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs, nl straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip, nl behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, nl depriving me of my best as for a purpose, nl unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist, nl deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and nl pasture-fields, nl immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, nl they bribed to swap off with

damp of the night drives deeper into my soul. nl (only what proves itself to every man and woman is so, nl only what nobody denies is so.) nl a minute and a drop of me settle my brain, nl i believe

vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to labrador, nl i follow quickly, i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the nl cliff. nl 32 nl i think i could turn and live with animals, they're so placid nl and self-contain'd, nl i stand and look at them long and long. nl they do not sweat and whine about their condition, nl they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, nl they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god, nl not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of nl owning things, nl not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands nl of

possession. nl i wonder where they get those tokens, nl did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop nl them? nl myself moving forward then and now and forever, nl gathering and showing more always and with velocity, nl infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them, nl not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers, nl picking out here one that i love, and now go with him on nl brotherly terms. nl a gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my nl caresses, nl head high in the forehead, wide between the ears, nl limbs glossy and supple, tail

alamo, nl not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo, nl the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo,) nl 'tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and nl twelve young men. nl retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their nl baggage for breastworks, nl nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine nl times their number, was the price they took in advance, nl their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone, nl they treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing nl and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners nl of war. nl they were the glory of the race of rangers, nl matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship, nl large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and nl affectionate, nl bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters, nl not a single one over thirty years of age. nl the second first-day morning they were brought out in nl squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer, nl the work commenced about five o'clock and was over by nl eight. nl none obey'd the command to kneel, nl some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and nl straight, nl a few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and nl dead lay together, nl the maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw nl them there, nl some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away, nl these were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the nl blunts of muskets. nl a youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two nl more came to release him, nl the three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood. nl at eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies; nl that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve nl young men. nl 35 nl would you hear of an old-time sea-fight? nl would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? nl list to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it nl to me. nl our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you, (said he,) nl his was the surly english pluck, and there is no tougher or nl truer, and never was, and never will be; nl along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us. nl we closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd, nl my captain lash'd fast with his own hands. nl we had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water, nl on our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first nl fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead. nl fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark, nl ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the nl gain, and five feet of water reported, nl the master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the nl after-hold to give them a chance for themselves. nl the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, nl they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust. nl our frigate takes fire, nl the other asks if we demand quarter? nl if our colors are struck and the fighting done? nl now i laugh content, for i hear the voice of my little captain, nl we have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun nl our part of the fighting. nl only three guns are in use, nl one is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's nl main-mast, nl two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry nl and clear his decks. nl the tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially nl the main-top, nl they hold out bravely during the whole of the action. nl not a moment's cease, nl the leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the nl powder-magazine. nl one of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought nl we are sinking. nl serene stands the little captain, nl he is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low, nl his eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns. nl toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender nl to us. nl 36 nl stretch'd and still lies the midnight, nl two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness, nl our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass nl to the one we have conquer'd, nl the captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders nl through a countenance white as a sheet, nl near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin, nl the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and nl carefully curl'd whiskers, nl the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and nl below, nl the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, nl formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of nl flesh upon the masts and spars, nl cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe nl of waves, nl black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong nl scent, nl a few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, nl delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields nl by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, nl the hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, nl wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and nl long, dull, tapering groan, nl these so, these irretrievable. nl 37 nl you laggards there on guard! look to your arms! nl in at the conquer'd doors they crowd! i am possess'd! nl embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering, nl see myself in prison shaped like another man, nl and feel the dull unintermitted pain, nl for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and nl keep watch, nl it is i let out in the morning and barr'd at night. nl not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but i am handcuff'd nl to him and walk by his side, nl (i am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with nl sweat on my twitching lips.) nl not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too, and am nl tried and sentenced. nl not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the nl last gasp, nl my face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me nl people retreat. nl askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in nl them, nl i project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg. nl 38 nl enough! enough! enough! nl somehow i have been stunn'd. stand back! nl give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, nl dreams, gaping, nl i discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake. nl that i could forget the mockers and insults! nl that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the nl bludgeons and hammers! nl that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion nl and bloody crowning! nl i remember now, nl i resume the overstaid fraction, nl the grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or nl to any graves, nl corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me. nl i troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an nl average unending procession, nl inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines, nl our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth, nl the blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of nl years. nl eleves, i salute you! come forward! nl continue your annotations, continue your questionings. nl 39 nl the friendly and flowing savage, who is he? nl is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering

nl wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him, nl they desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, nl stay with them. nl behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, nl

earth! you seem to look for something at my hands, nl say, old top-knot, what do you want? nl man or woman, i might tell how i like you, but cannot, nl and might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot, nl and might tell that pining i have, that pulse of my nights and nl days. nl behold, i do not give lectures or a little charity, nl when i give i give myself. nl you there,

nl sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides, nl ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real, nl ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, nl that breath of itches and

elasticity! nl o manhood, balanced, florid and full. nl my lovers suffocate me, nl crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, nl jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to nl

54,Miscél,Spells to fall asleep,"preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. his (stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. but how to get there was the rub. for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned. so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin's. but, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice. nl this was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. so, bevelling around by mullet's and the signal house, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus, mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. so, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. as it so happened a dublin united tramways company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station, the starting point for belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street, famous for its c division police station. between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen, associated with baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, o tell me where is fancy bread? at rourke's the baker's, it is said. nl en route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, mr bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old wall, he meant to say, or malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and, as mr bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, pembroke road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. you frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs. nl —and that one was judas, said stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind. nl discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. he began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's gumley. to avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge. nl —someone saluted you, mr bloom said. nl a figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: night! stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. mr bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. although unusual in the dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted. nl stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. lord john corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division, lately deceased, who had married a certain katherine brophy, the daughter of a louth farmer. his grandfather, patrick michael corley, of new ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine (also) talbot. rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. this, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley. nl taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. his friends had all deserted him. furthermore, he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. no, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. anyhow, he was ill in. nl —i wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and god knows i'm on the rocks. nl —there'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, stephen told him, in a boys' school at dalkey for a gentleman usher. mr garret deasy. try it. you may mention my name. nl —ah, god, corley replied, sure i couldn't teach in a school, man. i was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers. nl —i have no place to sleep myself, stephen informed him. nl corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. there was a dosshouse in marlborough street, mrs maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m'conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon) for a bob. he was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it. nl though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. however, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. he put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? however, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out. nl —those are halfcrowns, man, corley corrected him. nl and so in point of fact they turned out to be. stephen lent him one of them. nl —thanks, corley answered. you're a gentleman. i'll pay you back some time. who's that with you? i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker. you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. i'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. god, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the carl rosa. i don't give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper. nl subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in nagle's back with o'mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe. anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable. nl mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept. he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. pretty thick that was certainly. nl the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, stephen, that is: nl —he's down on his luck. he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman. nl at this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana, moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: nl —everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. now you mention it his face was familiar to me. but leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if i am not too inquisitive? nl —half-a-crown, stephen responded. i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere. nl —needs, mr bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does. everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. but talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? walking to sandycove is out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at westland row station. simply fag out there for nothing. i don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house? nl —to seek misfortune, was stephen's answer. nl —i met your respected father on a recent occasion, mr bloom diplomatically returned. today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. where does he live at present? i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved. nl —i believe he is in dublin somewhere, stephen answered unconcernedly. why? nl —a gifted man, mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. he takes great pride, quite legitimately, out of you. you could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, mulligan, that is, and that english tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give stephen the slip in the confusion. nl there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for maggy, boody and katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that. nl —no, mr bloom repeated again, i wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, dr mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if i were in your shoes. he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. of course you didn't notice as much as i did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object. nl he understood, however, from all he heard, that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries, or malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple. nl —except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out. nl the guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet. nl adjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties. nl —putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! ho ragione? culo rotto! nl —intendiamoci. mezzo sovrano più nl —dice lui, pero. nl —farabutto! mortacci sui! nl mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous skin-the-goat, fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. nl —now touching a cup of coffee, mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description. nl accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor. nl mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: nl —beautiful language. i mean for singing purposes. why do you not write your poetry in that language? bella poetria! it is so melodious and full. belladonna voglio. nl stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied: nl —to fill the ear of a cow elephant. they were haggling over money. nl —is that so? mr bloom asked. of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it. nl the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-à-tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him. nl —sounds are impostures, stephen said after a pause of some little time. like names, cicero, podmore, napoleon, mr goodbody, jesus, mr doyle. shakespeares were as common as murphies. what's in a name? nl —yes, to be sure, mr bloom unaffectedly concurred. of course. our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across. nl the redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: nl —and what might your name be? nl just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion's boot but stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered: nl —dedalus. nl the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old hollands and water. nl —you know simon dedalus? he asked at length. nl —i've heard of him, stephen said. nl mr bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too. nl —he's irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. all irish. nl —all too irish, stephen rejoined. nl as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. the left hand dead shot. nl though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. nl —bottle out there, say. fifty yards measured. eggs on the bottles. cocks his gun over his shoulder. aims. nl he turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. nl —pom, he then shouted once. nl the entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg. nl —pom, he shouted twice. nl egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: nl buffalo bill shoots to kill, nl never missed nor he never will. nl a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley. nl —beg pardon, the sailor said. nl —long ago? mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. nl —why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. he toured the wide world with hengler's royal circus. i seen him do that in stockholm. nl —curious coincidence, mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively. nl —murphy's my name, the sailor continued, w. b. murphy, of carrigaloe. know where that is? nl —queenstown harbour, stephen replied. nl —that's right, the sailor said. fort camden and fort carlisle. that's where i hails from. my little woman's down there. she's waiting for me, i know. for england, home and beauty. she's my own true wife i haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about. nl mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. across the world for a wife. quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic, enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o'leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. the face at the window! judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. you little expected me but i've come to stay and make a fresh start. there she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. believes me dead. rocked in the cradle of the deep. and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the crown and anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. no chair for father. boo! the wind! her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. with a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy o! bow to the inevitable. grin and bear it. i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, w. b. murphy. nl the sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: nl —you don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you? nl the jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand. nl —thank you, the sailor said. nl he deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded: nl —we come up this morning eleven o'clock. the threemaster rosevean from bridgwater with bricks. i shipped to get over. paid off this afternoon. there's my discharge. see? w. b. murphy, a. b. s. nl in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document. nl —you must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter. nl —why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, i've circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on. i was in the red sea. i was in china and north america and south america. i seen icebergs plenty, growlers. i was in stockholm and the black sea, the dardanelles, under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. i seen russia. gospodi pomilooy. that's how the russians prays. nl —you seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey. nl —why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, i seen queer things too, ups and downs. i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid. nl he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously. nl —khaan! like that. and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. look here. here they are. a friend of mine sent me. nl he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. the printed matter on it stated: choza de indios. beni, bolivia. nl all focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier. nl —chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. stomachs like breadgraters. cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. see them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw. nl his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more. nl —know how to keep them off? he inquired genially. nl nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying: nl —glass. that boggles 'em. glass. nl mr bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. it ran as follows: tarjeta postal. señor a. boudin, galeria becche, santiago, chile. there was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo-don cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest. martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, plymouth, falmouth, southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with. another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, eastbourne, scarborough, margate and so on, beautiful bournemouth, the channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness mrs c. p. m'coy type - lend me your valise and i'll post you the ticket. no, something top notch, an all star irish cast, the tweedy-flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody-manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. but who? that was the rub. nl also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard-rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. brown, robinson and co. nl it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. after all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when dame nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs, even, poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in wicklow, rightly termed the garden of ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while howth with its historic associations and otherwise, silken thomas, grace o'malley, george iv, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen. nl —i seen a chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different. one was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinese does. nl possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures. nl —and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap. knife in his back. knife like that. nl whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position. nl —in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. like that. prepare to meet your god, says he. chuck! it went into his back up to the butt. nl his heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. that's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto. nl after which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket. nl —they're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives. nl at this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, mr bloom and stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where skin-the-goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. his inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. funny very. nl there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. one man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman's discharge. mr bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen. nl —ay, boss, the sailor broke in. give us back them papers. nl the request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape. nl —have you seen the rock of gibraltar? mr bloom inquired. nl the sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no. nl —ah, you've touched there too, mr bloom said, europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. nl —what year would that be about? mr bloom interpolated. can you recall the boats? nl our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering. nl —i'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. salt junk all the time. nl tired, seemingly, he ceased. his questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves. on more than one occasion - a dozen at the lowest - near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. and it left him wondering why. possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights, kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather. nl —there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded. went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month. them are his trousers i've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. i'm game for that job, shaving and brushup. i hate roaming about. there's my son now, danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in cork where he could be drawing easy money. nl —what age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. nl —why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. my son danny? he'd be about eighteen now, way i figure it. nl the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor. nl —there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater, he remarked. sure as nuts. i must get a wash tomorrow or next day. it's them black lads i objects to. i hate those buggers. sucks your blood dry, they does. nl seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather. nl —tattoo, the exhibitor explained. that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton fellow the name of antonio done that. there he is himself, a greek. nl —did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor. nl that worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his. squeezing or... nl —see here, he said, showing antonio. there he is, cursing the mate. and there he is now, he added. the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn. nl and in point of fact the young man named antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including skin-the-goat who this time stretched over. nl —ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. he's gone too. ate by sharks after. ay, ay. nl he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before. nl —neat bit of work, longshoreman one said. nl —and what's the number for? loafer number two queried. nl —eaten alive? a third asked the sailor. nl —ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. a greek he was. nl and then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end: nl —as bad as old antonio, nl for he left me on my ownio. nl the face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. mr bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (mrs b.), and begged the chance of his washing. also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not? nl your washing. still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with bewley and draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. love me, love my dirty shirt. still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her. nl —the gunboat, the keeper said. nl —it beats me, mr bloom confided to stephen, medically i am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. unfortunate creature! of course, i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. still no matter what the cause is from... nl stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: nl —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. she is a bad merchant. she buys dear and sells cheap. nl the elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned. nl — you, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays, for instance. do you? nl thus cornered, stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: nl —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. it would be immortal, i understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause, who, from all i can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette. nl mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: nl —simple? i shouldn't think that is the proper word. of course, i grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did, or the telescope like edison, though i believe it was before his time, galileo was the man i mean. the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god. nl —o, that, stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in holy writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. on this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed. nl —has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point. i'm not so sure about that. that's a matter of every man's opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, i beg to differ with you in toto there. my belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like hamlet and bacon, as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i, of course i needn't tell you. can't you drink that coffee, by the way? let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. it's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. still, no one can give what he hasn't got. try a bit. nl —couldn't, stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further. nl faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, mr bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good. shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. on the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. the idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. sulphate of copper poison, so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where. anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble's vi-cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved. nl —have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. nl thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage. nl —still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, i'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. you ought to eat more solid food. you would feel a different man. nl —liquids i can eat, stephen said. but oblige me by taking away that knife. i can't look at the point of it. it reminds me of roman history. nl mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it. nl —our mutual friend's stories are like himself, mr bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce. do you think they are genuine? he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. look at him. nl yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel. nl he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. he might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. on the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera. and when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him. nl mind you, i'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. marcella, the midget queen. in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. they couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. there's an example again of simple souls. nl however, reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of ludwig, alias ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. on the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little italy there, near the coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap. nl —spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as old nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. it comes from the great heat, climate generally. my wife is, so to speak, spanish, half, that is. point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) spain, i.e. gibraltar. she has the spanish type. quite dark, regular brunette, black. i, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. that's why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian. nl —the temperaments at the door, stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. roberto ruba roba sua. nl —quite so, mr bloom dittoed. nl —then, stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle, miss portinari, he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino. nl —it's in the blood, mr bloom acceded at once. all are washed in the blood of the sun. coincidence, i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if i can so call it, and i was just looking at those antique statues there. the splendid proportions of hips, bosom. you simply don't knock against those kind of women here. an exception here and there. handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what i'm talking about is the female form. besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing i simply hate to see. nl interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say. he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him. nl so then after that they drifted on to the wreck of daunt's rock, wreck of that illfated norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it, palme, on booterstown strand, that was the talk of the town that year (albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. then someone said something about the case of the s. s. lady cairns of swansea, run into by the mona, which was on an opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. no aid was given. her master, the mona's, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. she had no water, it appears, in her hold. nl at this stage an incident happened. it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat. nl —let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful dose. nl he made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. while he was in the act of getting his bearings, mr bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. the irrepressible bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the loop line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank. nl a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of morpheus. a truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. he drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality. nl all, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin, the only launch that year. right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called. nl there were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait. nl what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that, eh? ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day's work. captain john lever of the lever line. nl —am i right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions. nl that worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. mr bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: nl —the biscuits was as hard as brass, nl and the beef as salt as lot's wife's arse. nl o johnny lever! nl johnny lever, o! nl after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided. nl skin-the-goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god's earth, far and away superior to england, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil, he stated, and there was colonel everard down there in cavan growing tobacco. where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon? but a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising all the conversation - was in store for mighty england, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. the boers were the beginning of the end. brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland, her achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles, the greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. his advice to every irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland. ireland, parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons. nl silence all round marked the termination of his finale. the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed. nl —take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism. nl to which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view. nl —who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. and the best jumpers and racers? and the best admirals and generals we've got? tell me that. nl —the irish for choice, retorted the cabby like campbell, facial blemishes apart. nl —that's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. the irish catholic peasant. he's the backbone of our empire. you know jem mullins? nl while allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it. then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows. nl from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart. another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her, more so, in fact. and now, why? so the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. and as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (bloom) couldn't help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence - or king's now - like denis or peter carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on nl his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then come up smiling again. generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern, come back to erin and so on. then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender. nl he took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, i let slip. he called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. so i, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his god, i mean christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality i'm not. that was one for him. a soft answer turns away wrath. he hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw. am i not right? nl he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly. nl —ex quibus, stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, christus or bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum carnem. nl —of course, mr bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. but with a little goodwill all round. it's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? i resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form. it never reaches anything or stops anything. a revolution must come on the due instalments plan. it's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak. nl —memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, stephen assented, between skinner's alley and ormond market. nl —yes, mr bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing. nl —you just took the words out of my mouth, he said. a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely. nl all those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop. nl —they accuse - remarked he audibly. he turned away from the others, who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they... nl —jews, he softly imparted in an aside in stephen's ear, are accused of ruining. not a vestige of truth in it, i can safely say. history - would you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them. why? because they are practical and are proved to be so. i don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... but in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead america. turks, it's in the dogma. because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better - at least, so i think. that's the juggle on which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. i'm, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum that's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. at least that's my idea for what it's worth. i call that patriotism. ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in alma mater, vita bene. where you can live well, the sense is, if you work. nl over his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, stephen stared at nothing in particular. he could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said - if you work. nl —count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work. nl the eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: all must work, have to, together. nl —i mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing. writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. that's work too. important work. after all, from the little i know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. what? you both belong to ireland, the brain and the brawn. each is equally important. nl —you suspect, stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short. nl —i would go a step farther, mr bloom insinuated. nl —but i suspect, stephen interrupted, that ireland must be important because it belongs to me. nl —what belongs? queried mr bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. excuse me. unfortunately i didn't catch the latter portion. what was it you?... nl stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee, or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding: nl —we can't change the country. let us change the subject. nl at this pertinent suggestion, mr bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign to his sober state. probably the home life, to which mr bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. with a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. for instance, there was the case of o'callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). and then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even in the house of lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good mrs grundy as the law stands was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. however, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. sheer force of natural genius, that. with brains, sir. nl for which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. still, to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small... intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. to improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as mr philip beaufoy if taken down in writing. suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, my experiences, let us say, in a cabman's shelter. nl the pink edition, extra sporting, of the telegraph, tell a graphic lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over

to change the subject he read about dignam, r.i.p., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. nl —this morning (hynes put it in, of course), the remains of the late mr patrick dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 newbridge avenue, sandymount, for internment in clasnevin. the deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. the obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly hynes wrote it with a nudge from corny) by messrs. h. j. o'neill & son, 164 north strand road. the mourners included: patk. dignam (son), bernard corrigan (motherinlaw), john henry menton, solr., martin cunningham,

simultaneously by c. p. m'coy and stephen dedalus, b. a., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of m'intosh), l. boom pointed it out to his companion b. a., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints. nl —is that first epistle to the hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it. nl —it is, really, mr bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at myles crawford's after all managing the thing, there. nl while the other was reading it on page two

thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. guesswork it reduced itself to eventually. nl —there was every indication they would arrive at that, mr bloom said. nl —who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said. nl one morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, return of parnell. he bet them what they liked. a dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in south africa. pride it was killed him. he ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after

his senses. dead he wasn't. simply absconded somewhere. the coffin they brought over was full of stones. he changed his name to de wet, the boer general. he made a mistake to fight the priests. and so forth and so on. nl all the same bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. something evidently riled them in his death. either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas messrs so-and-so who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. it certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. and the identical same with murderers. you had to come back - that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title rôle how to. he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's bred in the bone. still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. then a lot of shillyshally usually followed. tom for and dick and harry against. and then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in the tichborne case, roger charles tichborne. bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink, lord bellew, was it? as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, excuse me, my name is so-and-so or some such commonplace remark. a more prudent course, mr bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first. nl —that bitch, that english whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. she put the first nail in his coffin. nl —fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town-clerk, henry campbell remarked, and plenty of her. i seen her picture in a barber's. her husband was a captain or an officer. nl —ay, skin-the-goat amusingly added. he was, and a cottonball one. nl this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. as regards bloom, he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. first, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. the eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. and the coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. why, as he reflected, irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. north or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds. nl —just bears out what i was saying, he with glowing bosom said to stephen. and, if i don't greatly mistake, she was spanish too. nl —the king of spain's daughter, stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many. nl —was she? bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any means. i never heard that rumour before. possible, especially there it was, as she lived there. so, spain. nl carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he. nl —do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades photo which he laid on the table, that a spanish type? nl stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of womanhood, in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was in old madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, lafayette of westmoreland street, dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution. nl mrs bloom, my wife the prima donna, madam marion tweedy, bloom indicated. taken a few years since. in or about '96. very like her then. nl beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. as for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup she could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... he dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the national museum. marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. all the rest, yes, puritanism. it does though, st joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word. nl the spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow jack tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. but it was scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. in fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. suppose she was gone when he?... i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray. nl the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingué, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. and why not? an awful lot of make-believe went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. then the decree nisi and the king's proctor to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. but as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. he, bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery - (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland (a by no means, by the by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o'brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. his hat (parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: thank you, sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave. nl on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. he personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt. nl it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies' society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. to think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father. but something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely humpty dumpty boiled. nl —at what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face. nl —some time yesterday, stephen said. nl —yesterday, exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow, friday. ah, you mean it's after twelve! nl —the day before yesterday, stephen said, improving on himself. nl literally astounded at this piece of intelligence, bloom reflected. though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. for instance, when the evicted tenants' question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan's so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word. nl anyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to ontario terrace, as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. his initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. for one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. at all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. a move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let xx equal my right name and address, as mr algebra remarks passim. at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles, your god was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick-on-shannon or somewhere about in the county sligo. nl —i propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just come with me and talk things over. my diggings are quite close in the vicinity. you can't drink that stuff. wait, i'll just pay this lot. nl the best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn't seem to... nl —yes, that's the best, he assured stephen, to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. nl all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his (bloom's) busy brain. education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in english watering resorts packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck. an opening was all was wanted. because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to. nl the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in london somewhere. silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. - give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience. nl —and welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed. nl the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. nl —are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried. nl —why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green portholes as you might well describe them as, i uses goggles reading. sand in the red sea done that. one time i could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. the arabian nights' entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she. nl thereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of king willow, iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts, during which time (completely regardless of ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark. nl to cut a long story short bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the mohicans) he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as wetherup used to remark. - come, he counselled, to close the séance. nl seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to... nl —one thing i never understood, he said, to be original on the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafes. nl to which impromptu the never failing bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off: nl —to sweep the floor in the morning. nl so saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender achilles. the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins. nl —it will (the air) do you good, bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. the only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. it's not far. lean on me. nl accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen's right and led him on accordingly. nl —yes, stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that. nl anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex-gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. and apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. nl so they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across beresford place. wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante's huguenots, meyerbeer's seven last words on the cross, and mozart's twelfth mass, he simply revelled in, the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be. he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini's stabat mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, madam marion tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers' church in upper gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. on the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description, and martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn. and talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence lionel's air in martha, m'appari, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into praises of shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch, whom bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd (william), who played the virginals, he said, in the queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull. nl on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull. he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence. nl by the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: nl —our lives are in peril tonight. beware of the steamroller. nl they thereupon stopped. bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. but such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. he was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. but even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in barney kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. but it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from stephen's words, while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old... nl —what's this i was saying? ah, yes! my wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. nl he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built. nl still, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as lady fingall's irish industries concert on the preceding monday, and aristocracy in general. nl exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck, a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from. even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled bloom a bit: nl von der sirenen listigkeit nl tun die poeten dichten. nl these opening bars he sang and translated extempore. bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did. nl a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b. a. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in- society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record - in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne. yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. and it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. in fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all. nl the horse was just then. and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character, no pun intended. nl the horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted nl and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. and humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car. nl side by side bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards gardiner street lower, stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad. nl und alle schiffe brücken. nl the driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely nl watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by father maher. as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their téte à téte (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car."

nl the regularity of my design nl forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning, nl and therefore i shall open with a line nl (although it cost me half an hour in spinning) nl narrating somewhat of don juan's father, nl and also of his mother, if you 'd rather. nl in seville was he born, a pleasant city, nl famous for oranges and women—he nl who has not seen it will be much to pity, nl so says the proverb—and i quite agree; nl of all the spanish towns is none more pretty, nl cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see; nl don juan's parents lived beside the river, nl a noble stream, and call'd the guadalquivir. nl his father's name was jose—don, of course,— nl a true hidalgo, free from every stain nl of moor or hebrew blood, he traced his source nl through the most gothic gentlemen of spain; nl a better cavalier ne'er mounted horse, nl or, being mounted, e'er got down again, nl than jose, who begot our hero, who nl begot—but that 's to come—well, to renew: nl his mother was a learned lady, famed nl for every branch of every science known nl in every christian language ever named, nl with virtues equall'd by her wit alone, nl she made the cleverest people quite ashamed, nl and even the good with inward envy groan, nl finding themselves so very much exceeded nl in their own way by all the things that she did. nl her memory was a mine: she knew by heart nl all calderon and greater part of lope, nl so that if any actor miss'd his part nl she could have served him for the prompter's copy; nl for her feinagle's were an useless art, nl and he himself obliged to shut up shop—he nl could never make a memory so fine as nl that which adorn'd the brain of donna inez. nl her favourite science was the mathematical, nl her noblest virtue was her magnanimity, nl her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was attic all, nl her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity; nl in short, in all things she was fairly what i call nl a prodigy—her morning dress was dimity, nl her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin, nl and other stuffs, with which i won't stay puzzling. nl she knew the latin—that is, 'the lord's prayer,' nl and greek—the alphabet—i 'm nearly sure; nl she read some french romances here and there, nl although her mode of speaking was not pure; nl for native spanish she had no great care, nl at least her conversation was obscure; nl her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem, nl as if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em. nl she liked the english and the hebrew tongue, nl and said there was analogy between 'em; nl she proved it somehow out of sacred song, nl but i must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em; nl but this i heard her say, and can't be wrong nl and all may think which way their judgments lean 'em, nl ''t is strange—the hebrew noun which means ""i am,"" nl the english always use to govern d--n.' nl some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture, nl each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily, nl an all-in-all sufficient self-director, nl like the lamented late sir samuel romilly, nl the law's expounder, and the state's corrector, nl whose suicide was almost an anomaly— nl one sad example more, that 'all is vanity' nl (the jury brought their verdict in 'insanity'). nl in short, she was a walking calculation, nl miss edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers, nl or mrs. trimmer's books on education, nl or 'coelebs' wife' set out in quest of lovers, nl morality's prim personification, nl in which not envy's self a flaw discovers; nl to others' share let 'female errors fall,' nl for she had not even one—the worst of all. nl o! she was perfect past all parallel— nl of any modern female saint's comparison; nl so far above the cunning powers of hell, nl her guardian angel had given up his garrison; nl even her minutest motions went as well nl as those of the best time-piece made by harrison: nl in virtues nothing earthly could surpass her, nl save thine 'incomparable oil,' macassar! nl perfect she was, but as perfection is nl insipid in this naughty world of ours, nl where our first parents never learn'd to kiss nl till they were exiled from their earlier bowers, nl where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss nl (i wonder how they got through the twelve hours), nl don jose, like a lineal son of eve, nl went plucking various fruit without her leave. nl he was a mortal of the careless kind, nl with no great love for learning, or the learn'd, nl who chose to go where'er he had a mind, nl and never dream'd his lady was concern'd; nl the world, as usual, wickedly inclined nl to see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd, nl whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two— nl but for domestic quarrels one will do. nl now donna inez had, with all her merit, nl a great opinion of her own good qualities; nl neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it, nl and such, indeed, she was in her moralities; nl but then she had a devil of a spirit, nl and sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities, nl and let few opportunities escape nl of getting her liege lord into a scrape. nl this was an easy matter with a man nl oft in the wrong, and never on his guard; nl and even the wisest, do the best they can, nl have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared, nl that you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;' nl and sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard, nl and fans turn into falchions in fair hands, nl and why and wherefore no one understands. nl 't is pity learned virgins ever wed nl with persons of no sort of education, nl or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred, nl grow tired of scientific conversation: nl i don't choose to say much upon this head, nl i'm a plain man, and in a single station, nl but—oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual, nl inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all? nl don jose and his lady quarrell'd—why, nl not any of the many could divine, nl though several thousand people chose to try, nl 't was surely no concern of theirs nor mine; nl i loathe that low vice—curiosity; nl but if there 's anything in which i shine, nl 't is in arranging all my friends' affairs, nl not having of my own domestic cares. nl and so i interfered, and with the best nl intentions, but their treatment was not kind; nl i think the foolish people were possess'd, nl for neither of them could i ever find, nl although their porter afterwards confess'd— nl but that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind, nl for little juan o'er me threw, down stairs, nl a pail of housemaid's water unawares. nl a little curly-headed, good-for-nothing, nl and mischief-making monkey from his birth; nl his parents ne'er agreed except in doting nl upon the most unquiet imp on earth; nl instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in nl their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth nl to school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home, nl to teach him manners for the time to come. nl don jose and the donna inez led nl for some time an unhappy sort of life, nl wishing each other, not divorced, but dead; nl they lived respectably as man and wife, nl their conduct was exceedingly well-bred, nl and gave no outward signs of inward strife, nl until at length the smother'd fire broke out, nl and put the business past all kind of doubt. nl for inez call'd some druggists and physicians, nl and tried to prove her loving lord was mad; nl but as he had some lucid intermissions, nl she next decided he was only bad; nl yet when they ask'd her for her depositions, nl no sort of explanation could be had, nl save that her duty both to man and god nl required this conduct—which seem'd very odd. nl she kept a journal, where his faults were noted, nl and open'd certain trunks of books and letters, nl all which might, if occasion served, be quoted; nl and then she had all seville for abettors, nl besides her good old grandmother (who doted); nl the hearers of her case became repeaters, nl then advocates, inquisitors, and judges, nl some for amusement, others for old grudges. nl and then this best and weakest woman bore nl with such serenity her husband's woes, nl just as the spartan ladies did of yore, nl who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose nl never to say a word about them more— nl calmly she heard each calumny that rose, nl and saw his agonies with such sublimity, nl that all the world exclaim'd, 'what magnanimity!' nl no doubt this patience, when the world is damning us, nl is philosophic in our former friends; nl 't is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous, nl the more so in obtaining our own ends; nl and what the lawyers call a 'malus animus' nl conduct like this by no means comprehends; nl revenge in person 's certainly no virtue, nl but then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you. nl and if your quarrels should rip up old stories, nl and help them with a lie or two additional, nl i 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is nl any one else—they were become traditional; nl besides, their resurrection aids our glories nl by contrast, which is what we just were wishing all: nl and science profits by this resurrection— nl dead scandals form good subjects for dissection. nl their friends had tried at reconciliation, nl then their relations, who made matters worse. nl ('t were hard to tell upon a like occasion nl to whom it may be best to have recourse— nl i can't say much for friend or yet relation): nl the lawyers did their utmost for divorce, nl but scarce a fee was paid on either side nl before, unluckily, don jose died. nl he died: and most unluckily, because, nl according to all hints i could collect nl from counsel learned in those kinds of laws nl (although their talk 's obscure and circumspect), nl his death contrived to spoil a charming cause; nl a thousand pities also with respect nl to public feeling, which on this occasion nl was manifested in a great sensation. nl but, ah! he died; and buried with him lay nl the public feeling and the lawyers' fees: nl his house was sold, his servants sent away, nl a jew took one of his two mistresses, nl a priest the other—at least so they say: nl i ask'd the doctors after his disease— nl he died of the slow fever call'd the tertian, nl and left his widow to her own aversion. nl yet jose was an honourable man, nl that i must say who knew him very well; nl therefore his frailties i 'll no further scan nl indeed there were not many more to tell; nl and if his passions now and then outran nl discretion, and were not so peaceable nl as numa's (who was also named pompilius), nl he had been ill brought up, and was born bilious. nl whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth, nl poor fellow! he had many things to wound him. nl let 's own—since it can do no good on earth— nl it was a trying moment that which found him nl standing alone beside his desolate hearth, nl where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him: nl no choice was left his feelings or his pride, nl save death or doctors' commons—so he died. nl dying intestate, juan was sole heir nl to a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands, nl which, with a long minority and care, nl promised to turn out well in proper hands: nl inez became sole guardian, which was fair, nl and answer'd but to nature's just demands; nl an only son left with an only mother nl is brought up much more wisely than another. nl sagest of women, even of widows, she nl resolved that juan should be quite a paragon, nl and worthy of the noblest pedigree nl (his sire was of castile, his dam from aragon): nl then for accomplishments of chivalry, nl in case our lord the king should go to war again, nl he learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery, nl and how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery. nl but that which donna inez most desired, nl and saw into herself each day before all nl the learned tutors whom for him she hired, nl was, that his breeding should be strictly moral; nl much into all his studies she inquired, nl and so they were submitted first to her, all, nl arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery nl to juan's eyes, excepting natural history. nl the languages, especially the dead, nl the sciences, and most of all the abstruse, nl the arts, at least all such as could be said nl to be the most remote from common use, nl in all these he was much and deeply read; nl but not a page of any thing that 's loose, nl or hints continuation of the species, nl was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious. nl his classic studies made a little puzzle, nl because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses, nl who in the earlier ages raised a bustle, nl but never put on pantaloons or bodices; nl his reverend tutors had at times a tussle, nl and for their aeneids, iliads, and odysseys, nl were forced to make an odd sort of apology, nl for donna inez dreaded the mythology. nl ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him, nl anacreon's morals are a still worse sample, nl catullus scarcely has a decent poem, nl i don't think sappho's ode a good example, nl although longinus tells us there is no hymn nl where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample: nl but virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one nl beginning with 'formosum pastor corydon.' nl lucretius' irreligion is too strong, nl for early stomachs, to prove wholesome food; nl i can't help thinking juvenal was wrong, nl although no doubt his real intent was good, nl for speaking out so plainly in his song, nl so much indeed as to be downright rude; nl and then what proper person can be partial nl to all those nauseous epigrams of martial? nl juan was taught from out the best edition, nl expurgated by learned men, who place nl judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision, nl the grosser parts; but, fearful to deface nl too much their modest bard by this omission, nl and pitying sore his mutilated case, nl they only add them all in an appendix, nl which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index; nl for there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,' nl instead of being scatter'd through the pages; nl they stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop, nl to meet the ingenuous youth of future ages, nl till some less rigid editor shall stoop nl to call them back into their separate cages, nl instead of standing staring all together, nl like garden gods—and not so decent either. nl the missal too (it was the family missal) nl was ornamented in a sort of way nl which ancient mass-books often are, and this all nl kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they, nl who saw those figures on the margin kiss all, nl could turn their optics to the text and pray, nl is more than i know—but don juan's mother nl kept this herself, and gave her son another. nl sermons he read, and lectures he endured, nl and homilies, and lives of all the saints; nl to jerome and to chrysostom inured, nl he did not take such studies for restraints; nl but how faith is acquired, and then ensured, nl so well not one of the aforesaid paints nl as saint augustine in his fine confessions, nl which make the reader envy his transgressions. nl this, too, was a seal'd book to little juan— nl i can't but say that his mamma was right, nl if such an education was the true one. nl she scarcely trusted him from out her sight; nl her maids were old, and if she took a new one, nl you might be sure she was a perfect fright; nl she did this during even her husband's life— nl i recommend as much to every wife. nl young juan wax'd in goodliness and grace; nl at six a charming child, and at eleven nl with all the promise of as fine a face nl as e'er to man's maturer growth was given: nl he studied steadily, and grew apace, nl and seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven, nl for half his days were pass'd at church, the other nl between his tutors, confessor, and mother. nl at six, i said, he was a charming child, nl at twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy; nl although in infancy a little wild, nl they tamed him down amongst them: to destroy nl his natural spirit not in vain they toil'd, nl at least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy nl was to declare how sage, and still, and steady, nl her young philosopher was grown already. nl i had my doubts, perhaps i have them still, nl but what i say is neither here nor there: nl i knew his father well, and have some skill nl in character—but it would not be fair nl from sire to son to augur good or ill: nl he and his wife were an ill-sorted pair— nl but scandal 's my aversion—i protest nl against all evil speaking, even in jest. nl for my part i say nothing—nothing—but nl this i will say—my reasons are my own— nl that if i had an only son to put nl to school (as god be praised that i have none), nl 't is not with donna inez i would shut nl him up to learn his catechism alone, nl no—no—i 'd send him out betimes to college, nl for there it was i pick'd up my own knowledge. nl for there one learns—'t is not for me to boast, nl though i acquired—but i pass over that, nl as well as all the greek i since have lost: nl i say that there 's the place—but 'verbum sat.' nl i think i pick'd up too, as well as most, nl knowledge of matters—but no matter what— nl i never married—but, i think, i know nl that sons should not be educated so. nl young juan now was sixteen years of age, nl tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd nl active, though not so sprightly, as a page; nl and everybody but his mother deem'd nl him almost man; but she flew in a rage nl and bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd) nl if any said so, for to be precocious nl was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious. nl amongst her numerous acquaintance, all nl selected for discretion and devotion, nl there was the donna julia, whom to call nl pretty were but to give a feeble notion nl of many charms in her as natural nl as sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean, nl her zone to venus, or his bow to cupid nl (but this last simile is trite and stupid). nl the darkness of her oriental eye nl accorded with her moorish origin nl (her blood was not all spanish, by the by; nl in spain, you know, this is a sort of sin); nl when proud granada fell, and, forced to fly, nl boabdil wept, of donna julia's kin nl some went to africa, some stay'd in spain, nl her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain. nl she married (i forget the pedigree) nl with an hidalgo, who transmitted down nl his blood less noble than such blood should be; nl at such alliances his sires would frown, nl in that point so precise in each degree nl that they bred in and in, as might be shown, nl marrying their cousins—nay, their aunts, and nieces, nl which always spoils the breed, if it increases. nl this heathenish cross restored the breed again, nl ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh; nl for from a root the ugliest in old spain nl sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh; nl the sons no more were short, the daughters plain: nl but there 's a rumour which i fain would hush, nl 't is said that donna julia's grandmamma nl produced her don more heirs at love than law. nl however this might be, the race went on nl improving still through every generation, nl until it centred in an only son, nl who left an only daughter; my narration nl may have suggested that this single one nl could be but julia (whom on this occasion nl i shall have much to speak about), and she nl was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three. nl her eye (i 'm very fond of handsome eyes) nl was large and dark, suppressing half its fire nl until she spoke, then through its soft disguise nl flash'd an expression more of pride than ire, nl and love than either; and there would arise nl a something in them which was not desire, nl but would have been, perhaps, but for the soul nl which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole. nl her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow nl bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth; nl her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow, nl her cheek all purple with the beam of youth, nl mounting at times to a transparent glow, nl as if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth, nl possess'd an air and grace by no means common: nl her stature tall—i hate a dumpy woman. nl wedded she was some years, and to a man nl of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty; nl and yet, i think, instead of such a one nl 't were better to have two of five-and-twenty, nl especially in countries near the sun: nl and now i think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,' nl ladies even of the most uneasy virtue nl prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty. nl 't is a sad thing, i cannot choose but say, nl and all the fault of that indecent sun, nl who cannot leave alone our helpless clay, nl but will keep baking, broiling, burning on, nl that howsoever people fast and pray, nl the flesh is frail, and so the soul undone: nl what men call gallantry, and gods adultery, nl is much more common where the climate 's sultry. nl happy the nations of the moral north! nl where all is virtue, and the winter season nl sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth nl ('t was snow that brought st. anthony to reason); nl where juries cast up what a wife is worth, nl by laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on nl the lover, who must pay a handsome price, nl because it is a marketable vice. nl alfonso was the name of julia's lord, nl a man well looking for his years, and who nl was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd: nl they lived together, as most people do, nl suffering each other's foibles by accord, nl and not exactly either one or two; nl yet he was jealous, though he did not show it, nl for jealousy dislikes the world to know it. nl julia was—yet i never could see why— nl with donna inez quite a favourite friend; nl between their tastes there was small sympathy, nl for not a line had julia ever penn'd: nl some people whisper but no doubt they lie, nl for malice still imputes some private end, nl that inez had, ere don alfonso's marriage, nl forgot with him her very prudent carriage; nl and that still keeping up the old connection, nl which time had lately render'd much more chaste, nl she took his lady also in affection, nl and certainly this course was much the best: nl she flatter'd julia with her sage protection, nl and complimented don alfonso's taste; nl and if she could not (who can?) silence scandal, nl at least she left it a more slender handle. nl i can't tell whether julia saw the affair nl with other people's eyes, or if her own nl discoveries made, but none could be aware nl of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown; nl perhaps she did not know, or did not care, nl indifferent from the first or callous grown: nl i 'm really puzzled what to think or say, nl she kept her counsel in so close a way. nl juan she saw, and, as a pretty child, nl caress'd him often—such a thing might be nl quite innocently done, and harmless styled, nl when she had twenty years, and thirteen he; nl but i am not so sure i should have smiled nl when he was sixteen, julia twenty-three; nl these few short years make wondrous alterations, nl particularly amongst sun-burnt nations. nl whate'er the cause might be, they had become nl changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy, nl their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb, nl and much embarrassment in either eye; nl there surely will be little doubt with some nl that donna julia knew the reason why, nl but as for juan, he had no more notion nl than he who never saw the sea of ocean. nl yet julia's very coldness still was kind, nl and tremulously gentle her small hand nl withdrew itself from his, but left behind nl a little pressure, thrilling, and so bland nl and slight, so very slight, that to the mind nl 't was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand nl wrought change with all armida's fairy art nl like what this light touch left on juan's heart. nl and if she met him, though she smiled no more, nl she look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile, nl as if her heart had deeper thoughts in store nl she must not own, but cherish'd more the while nl for that compression in its burning core; nl even innocence itself has many a wile, nl and will not dare to trust itself with truth, nl and love is taught hypocrisy from youth. nl but passion most dissembles, yet betrays nl even by its darkness; as the blackest sky nl foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays nl its workings through the vainly guarded eye, nl and in whatever aspect it arrays nl itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy; nl coldness or anger, even disdain or hate, nl are masks it often wears, and still too late. nl then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression, nl and stolen glances, sweeter for the theft, nl and burning blushes, though for no transgression, nl tremblings when met, and restlessness when left; nl all these are little preludes to possession, nl of which young passion cannot be bereft, nl and merely tend to show how greatly love is nl embarrass'd at first starting with a novice. nl poor julia's heart was in an awkward state; nl she felt it going, and resolved to make nl the noblest efforts for herself and mate, nl for honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake; nl her resolutions were most truly great, nl and almost might have made a tarquin quake: nl she pray'd the virgin mary for her grace, nl as being the best judge of a lady's case. nl she vow'd she never would see juan more, nl and next day paid a visit to his mother, nl and look'd extremely at the opening door, nl which, by the virgin's grace, let in another; nl grateful she was, and yet a little sore— nl again it opens, it can be no other, nl 't is surely juan now—no! i 'm afraid nl that night the virgin was no further pray'd. nl she now determined that a virtuous woman nl should rather face and overcome temptation, nl that flight was base and dastardly, and no man nl should ever give her heart the least sensation; nl that is to say, a thought beyond the common nl preference, that we must feel upon occasion nl for people who are pleasanter than others, nl but then they only seem so many brothers. nl and even if by chance—and who can tell? nl the devil 's so very sly—she should discover nl that all within was not so very well, nl and, if still free, that such or such a lover nl might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell nl such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over; nl and if the man should ask, 't is but denial: nl i recommend young ladies to make trial. nl and then there are such things as love divine, nl bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure, nl such as the angels think so very fine, nl and matrons who would be no less secure, nl platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;' nl thus julia said—and thought so, to be sure; nl and so i 'd have her think, were i the man nl on whom her reveries celestial ran. nl such love is innocent, and may exist nl between young persons without any danger. nl a hand may first, and then a lip be kist; nl for my part, to such doings i 'm a stranger, nl but hear these freedoms form the utmost list nl of all o'er which such love may be a ranger: nl if people go beyond, 't is quite a crime, nl but not my fault—i tell them all in time. nl love, then, but love within its proper limits, nl was julia's innocent determination nl in young don juan's favour, and to him its nl exertion might be useful on occasion; nl and, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its nl ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion nl he might be taught, by love and her together— nl i really don't know what, nor julia either. nl fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced nl in mail of proof—her purity of soul— nl she, for the future of her strength convinced. nl and that her honour was a rock, or mole, nl exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed nl with any kind of troublesome control; nl but whether julia to the task was equal nl is that which must be mention'd in the sequel. nl her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible, nl and, surely, with a stripling of sixteen nl not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable, nl or if they did so, satisfied to mean nl nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable— nl a quiet conscience makes one so serene! nl christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded nl that all the apostles would have done as they did. nl and if in the mean time her husband died, nl but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross nl her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd) nl never could she survive that common loss; nl but just suppose that moment should betide, nl i only say suppose it—inter nos. nl (this should be entre nous, for julia thought nl in french, but then the rhyme would go for naught.) nl i only say suppose this supposition: nl juan being then grown up to man's estate nl would fully suit a widow of condition, nl even seven years hence it would not be too late; nl and in the interim (to pursue this vision) nl the mischief, after all, could not be great, nl for he would learn the rudiments of love, nl i mean the seraph way of those above. nl so much for julia. now we 'll turn to juan. nl poor little fellow! he had no idea nl of his own case, and never hit the true one; nl in feelings quick as ovid's miss medea, nl he puzzled over what he found a new one, nl but not as yet imagined it could be nl thing quite in course, and not at all alarming, nl which, with a little patience, might grow charming. nl silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow, nl his home deserted for the lonely wood, nl tormented with a wound he could not know, nl his, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude: nl i 'm fond myself of solitude or so, nl but then, i beg it may be understood, nl by solitude i mean a sultan's, not nl a hermit's, with a haram for a grot. nl 'oh love! in such a wilderness as this, nl where transport and security entwine, nl here is the empire of thy perfect bliss, nl and here thou art a god indeed divine.' nl the bard i quote from does not sing amiss, nl with the exception of the second line, nl for that same twining 'transport and security' nl are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity. nl the poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals nl to the good sense and senses of mankind, nl the very thing which every body feels, nl as all have found on trial, or may find, nl that no one likes to be disturb'd at meals nl or love.—i won't say more about 'entwined' nl or 'transport,' as we knew all that before, nl but beg 'security' will bolt the door. nl young juan wander'd by the glassy brooks, nl thinking unutterable things; he threw nl himself at length within the leafy nooks nl where the wild branch of the cork forest grew; nl there poets find materials for their books, nl and every now and then we read them through, nl so that their plan and prosody are eligible, nl unless, like wordsworth, they prove unintelligible. nl he, juan (and not wordsworth), so pursued nl his self-communion with his own high soul, nl until his mighty heart, in its great mood, nl had mitigated part, though not the whole nl of its disease; he did the best he could nl with things not very subject to control, nl and turn'd, without perceiving his condition, nl like coleridge, into a metaphysician. nl he thought about himself, and the whole earth nl of man the wonderful, and of the stars, nl and how the deuce they ever could have birth; nl and then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars, nl how many miles the moon might have in girth, nl of air-balloons, and of the many bars nl to perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;— nl and then he thought of donna julia's eyes. nl in thoughts like these true wisdom may discern nl longings sublime, and aspirations high, nl which some are born with, but the most part learn nl to plague themselves withal, they know not why: nl 't was strange that one so young should thus concern nl his brain about the action of the sky; nl if you think 't was philosophy that this did, nl i can't help thinking puberty assisted. nl he pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers, nl and heard a voice in all the winds; and then nl he thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers, nl and how the goddesses came down to men: nl he miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours, nl and when he look'd upon his watch again, nl he found how much old time had been a winner— nl he also found that he had lost his dinner. nl sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book, nl boscan, or garcilasso;—by the wind nl even as the page is rustled while we look, nl so by the poesy of his own mind nl over the mystic leaf his soul was shook, nl as if 't were one whereon magicians bind nl their spells, and give them to the passing gale, nl according to some good old woman's tale. nl thus would he while his lonely hours away nl dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted; nl nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay, nl could yield his spirit that for which it panted, nl a bosom whereon he his head might lay, nl and hear the heart beat with the love it granted, nl with—several other things, which i forget, nl or which, at least, i need not mention yet. nl those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries, nl could not escape the gentle julia's eyes; nl she saw that juan was not at his ease; nl but that which chiefly may, and must surprise, nl is, that the donna inez did not tease nl her only son with question or surmise: nl whether it was she did not see, or would not, nl or, like all very clever people, could not. nl this may seem strange, but yet 't is very common; nl for instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take nl leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman, nl and break the—which commandment is 't they break? nl (i have forgot the number, and think no man nl should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.) nl i say, when these same gentlemen are jealous, nl they make some blunder, which their ladies tell us. nl a real husband always is suspicious, nl but still no less suspects in the wrong place, nl jealous of some one who had no such wishes, nl or pandering blindly to his own disgrace, nl by harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious; nl the last indeed 's infallibly the case: nl and when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly, nl he wonders at their vice, and not his folly. nl thus parents also are at times short-sighted; nl though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover, nl the while the wicked world beholds delighted, nl young hopeful's mistress, or miss fanny's lover, nl till some confounded escapade has blighted nl the plan of twenty years, and all is over; nl and then the mother cries, the father swears, nl and wonders why the devil he got heirs. nl but inez was so anxious, and so clear nl of sight, that i must think, on this occasion, nl she had some other motive much more near nl for leaving juan to this new temptation; nl but what that motive was, i sha'n't say here; nl perhaps to finish juan's education, nl perhaps to open don alfonso's eyes, nl in case he thought his wife too great a prize. nl it was upon a day, a summer's day.— nl summer's indeed a very dangerous season, nl and so is spring about the end of may; nl the sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason; nl but whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say, nl and stand convicted of more truth than treason, nl that there are months which nature grows more merry in,— nl march has its hares, and may must have its heroine. nl 't was on a summer's day—the sixth of june:— nl i like to be particular in dates, nl not only of the age, and year, but moon; nl they are a sort of post-house, where the fates nl change horses, making history change its tune, nl then spur away o'er empires and o'er states, nl leaving at last not much besides chronology, nl excepting the post-obits of theology. nl 't was on the sixth of june, about the hour nl of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven— nl when julia sate within as pretty a bower nl as e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven nl described by mahomet, and anacreon moore, nl to whom the lyre and laurels have been given, nl with all the trophies of triumphant song— nl he won them well, and may he wear them long! nl she sate, but not alone; i know not well nl how this same interview had taken place, nl and even if i knew, i should not tell— nl people should hold their tongues in any case; nl no matter how or why the thing befell, nl but there were she and juan, face to face— nl when two such faces are so, 't would be wise, nl but very difficult, to shut their eyes. nl how beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart nl glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong. nl o love! how perfect is thy mystic art, nl strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong, nl how self-deceitful is the sagest part nl of mortals whom thy lure hath led along— nl the precipice she stood on was immense, nl so was her creed in her own innocence. nl she thought of her own strength, and juan's youth, nl and of the folly of all prudish fears, nl victorious virtue, and domestic truth, nl and then of don alfonso's fifty years: nl i wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth, nl because that number rarely much endears, nl and through all climes, the snowy and the sunny, nl sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money. nl when people say, 'i've told you fifty times,' nl they mean to scold, and very often do; nl when poets say, 'i've written fifty rhymes,' nl they make you dread that they 'll recite them too; nl in gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes; nl at fifty love for love is rare, 't is true, nl but then, no doubt, it equally as true is, nl a good deal may be bought for fifty louis. nl julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love, nl for don alfonso; and she inly swore, nl by all the vows below to powers above, nl she never would disgrace the ring she wore, nl nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove; nl and while she ponder'd this, besides much more, nl one hand on juan's carelessly was thrown, nl quite by mistake—she thought it was her own; nl unconsciously she lean'd upon the other, nl which play'd within the tangles of her hair: nl and to contend with thoughts she could not smother nl she seem'd by the distraction of her air. nl 't was surely very wrong in juan's mother nl to leave together this imprudent pair, nl she who for many years had watch'd her son so— nl i 'm very certain mine would not have done so. nl the hand which still held juan's, by degrees nl gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp, nl as if it said, 'detain me, if you please;' nl yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp nl his fingers with a pure platonic squeeze: nl she would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp, nl had she imagined such a thing could rouse nl a feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse. nl i cannot know what juan thought of this, nl but what he did, is much what you would do; nl his young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss, nl and then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew nl in deep despair, lest he had done amiss,— nl love is so very timid when 't is new: nl she blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak, nl and held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak. nl the sun set, and up rose the yellow moon: nl the devil 's in the moon for mischief; they nl who call'd her chaste, methinks, began too soon nl their nomenclature; there is not a day, nl the longest, not the twenty-first of june, nl sees half the business in a wicked way nl on which three single hours of moonshine smile— nl and then she looks so modest all the while. nl there is a dangerous silence in that hour, nl a stillness, which leaves room for the full soul nl to open all itself, without the power nl of calling wholly back its self-control; nl the silver light which, hallowing tree and tower, nl sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole, nl breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws nl a loving languor, which is not repose. nl and julia sate with juan, half embraced nl and half retiring from the glowing arm, nl which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed; nl yet still she must have thought there was no harm, nl or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist; nl but then the situation had its charm, nl and then—god knows what next—i can't go on; nl i 'm almost sorry that i e'er begun. nl o plato! plato! you have paved the way, nl with your confounded fantasies, to more nl immoral conduct by the fancied sway nl your system feigns o'er the controulless core nl of human hearts, than all the long array nl of poets and romancers:—you 're a bore, nl a charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been, nl at best, no better than a go-between. nl and julia's voice was lost, except in sighs, nl until too late for useful conversation; nl the tears were gushing from her gentle eyes, nl i wish indeed they had not had occasion, nl but who, alas! can love, and then be wise? nl not that remorse did not oppose temptation; nl a little still she strove, and much repented nl and whispering 'i will ne'er consent'—consented. nl 't is said that xerxes offer'd a reward nl to those who could invent him a new pleasure: nl methinks the requisition 's rather hard, nl and must have cost his majesty a treasure: nl for my part, i 'm a moderate-minded bard, nl fond of a little love (which i call leisure); nl i care not for new pleasures, as the old nl are quite enough for me, so they but hold. nl o pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing, nl although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt: nl i make a resolution every spring nl of reformation, ere the year run out, nl but somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing, nl yet still, i trust it may be kept throughout: nl i 'm very sorry, very much ashamed, nl and mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd. nl here my chaste muse a liberty must take— nl start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence— nl forward, and there is no great cause to quake; nl this liberty is a poetic licence, nl which some irregularity may make nl in the design, and as i have a high sense nl of aristotle and the rules, 't is fit nl to beg his pardon when i err a bit. nl this licence is to hope the reader will nl suppose from june the sixth (the fatal day, nl without whose epoch my poetic skill nl for want of facts would all be thrown away), nl but keeping julia and don juan still nl in sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say nl 't was in november, but i 'm not so sure nl about the day—the era 's more obscure. nl we 'll talk of that anon.—'t is sweet to hear nl at midnight on the blue and moonlit deep nl the song and oar of adria's gondolier, nl by distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep; nl 't is sweet to see the evening star appear; nl 't is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep nl from leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high nl the rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky. nl 't is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark nl bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home; nl 't is sweet to know there is an eye will mark nl our coming, and look brighter when we come; nl 't is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark, nl or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum nl of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds, nl the lisp of children, and their earliest words. nl sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes nl in bacchanal profusion reel to earth, nl purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes nl from civic revelry to rural mirth; nl sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps, nl sweet to the father is his first-born's birth, nl sweet is revenge—especially to women, nl pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen. nl sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet nl the unexpected death of some old lady nl or gentleman of seventy years complete, nl who 've made 'us youth' wait too—too long already nl for an estate, or cash, or country seat, nl still breaking, but with stamina so steady nl that all the israelites are fit to mob its nl next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits. nl 't is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels, nl by blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end nl to strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels, nl particularly with a tiresome friend: nl sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels; nl dear is the helpless creature we defend nl against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot nl we ne'er forget, though there we are forgot. nl but sweeter still than this, than these, than all, nl is first and passionate love—it stands alone, nl like adam's recollection of his fall; nl the tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known— nl and life yields nothing further to recall nl worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown, nl no doubt in fable, as the unforgiven nl fire which prometheus filch'd for us from heaven. nl man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use nl of his own nature, and the various arts, nl and likes particularly to produce nl some new experiment to show his parts; nl this is the age of oddities let loose, nl where different talents find their different marts; nl you 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your nl labour, there 's a sure market for imposture. nl what opposite discoveries we have seen! nl (signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.) nl one makes new noses, one a guillotine, nl one breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets; nl but vaccination certainly has been nl a kind antithesis to congreve's rockets, nl with which the doctor paid off an old pox, nl by borrowing a new one from an ox. nl bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes; nl and galvanism has set some corpses grinning, nl but has not answer'd like the apparatus nl of the humane society's beginning nl by which men are unsuffocated gratis: nl what wondrous new machines have late been spinning! nl i said the small-pox has gone out of late; nl perhaps it may be follow'd by the great. nl 't is said the great came from america; nl perhaps it may set out on its return,— nl the population there so spreads, they say nl 't is grown high time to thin it in its turn, nl with war, or plague, or famine, any way, nl so that civilisation they may learn; nl and which in ravage the more loathsome evil is— nl their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis? nl this is the patent-age of new inventions nl for killing bodies, and for saving souls, nl all propagated with the best intentions; nl sir humphry davy's lantern, by which coals nl are safely mined for in the mode he mentions, nl tombuctoo travels, voyages to the poles, nl are ways to benefit mankind, as true, nl perhaps, as shooting them at waterloo. nl man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what, nl and wonderful beyond all wondrous measure; nl 't is pity though, in this sublime world, that nl pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure; nl few mortals know what end they would be at, nl but whether glory, power, or love, or treasure, nl the path is through perplexing ways, and when nl the goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then— nl what then?—i do not know, no more do you— nl and so good night.—return we to our story: nl 't was in november, when fine days are few, nl and the far mountains wax a little hoary, nl and clap a white cape on their mantles blue; nl and the sea dashes round the promontory, nl and the loud breaker boils against the rock, nl and sober suns must set at five o'clock. nl 't was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night; nl no moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud nl by gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright nl with the piled wood, round which the family crowd; nl there 's something cheerful in that sort of light, nl even as a summer sky 's without a cloud: nl i 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that, nl a lobster salad, and champagne, and chat. nl 't was midnight—donna julia was in bed, nl sleeping, most probably,—when at her door nl arose a clatter might awake the dead, nl if they had never been awoke before, nl and that they have been so we all have read, nl and are to be so, at the least, once more.-- nl the door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist nl first knocks were heard, then 'madam—madam—hist! nl 'for god's sake, madam—madam—here 's my master, nl with more than half the city at his back— nl was ever heard of such a curst disaster! nl 't is not my fault—i kept good watch—alack! nl do pray undo the bolt a little faster— nl they 're on the stair just now, and in a crack nl will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly— nl surely the window 's not so very high!' nl by this time don alfonso was arrived, nl with torches, friends, and servants in great number; nl the major part of them had long been wived, nl and therefore paused not to disturb the slumber nl of any wicked woman, who contrived nl by stealth her husband's temples to encumber: nl examples of this kind are so contagious, nl were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous. nl i can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion nl could enter into don alfonso's head; nl but for a cavalier of his condition nl it surely was exceedingly ill-bred, nl without a word of previous admonition, nl to hold a levee round his lady's bed, nl and summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword, nl to prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd. nl poor donna julia, starting as from sleep nl (mind—that i do not say—she had not slept), nl began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep; nl her maid antonia, who was an adept, nl contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap, nl as if she had just now from out them crept: nl i can't tell why she should take all this trouble nl to prove her mistress had been sleeping double. nl but julia mistress, and antonia maid, nl appear'd like two poor harmless women, who nl of goblins, but still more of men afraid, nl had thought one man might be deterr'd by two, nl and therefore side by side were gently laid, nl until the hours of absence should run through, nl and truant husband should return, and say, nl 'my dear, i was the first who came away.' nl now julia found at length a voice, and cried, nl 'in heaven's name, don alfonso, what d' ye mean? nl has madness seized you? would that i had died nl ere such a monster's victim i had been! nl what may this midnight violence betide, nl a sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen? nl dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill? nl search, then, the room!'—alfonso said, 'i will.' nl he search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere, nl closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat, nl and found much linen, lace, and several pair nl of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete, nl with other articles of ladies fair, nl to keep them beautiful, or leave them neat: nl arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords, nl and wounded several shutters, and some boards. nl under the bed they search'd, and there they found— nl no matter what—it was not that they sought; nl they open'd windows, gazing if the ground nl had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought; nl and then they stared each other's faces round: nl 't is odd, not one of all these seekers thought, nl and seems to me almost a sort of blunder, nl of looking in the bed as well as under. nl during this inquisition, julia's tongue nl was not asleep—'yes, search and search,' she cried, nl 'insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong! nl it was for this that i became a bride! nl for this in silence i have suffer'd long nl a husband like alfonso at my side; nl but now i 'll bear no more, nor here remain, nl if there be law or lawyers in all spain. nl 'yes, don alfonso! husband now no more, nl if ever you indeed deserved the name, nl is 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore— nl fifty, or sixty, it is all the same— nl is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore nl for facts against a virtuous woman's fame? nl ungrateful, perjured, barbarous don alfonso, nl how dare you think your lady would go on so? nl 'is it for this i have disdain'd to hold nl the common privileges of my sex? nl that i have chosen a confessor so old nl and deaf, that any other it would vex, nl and never once he has had cause to scold, nl but found my very innocence perplex nl so much, he always doubted i was married— nl how sorry you will be when i 've miscarried! nl 'was it for this that no cortejo e'er nl i yet have chosen from out the youth of seville? nl is it for this i scarce went anywhere, nl except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel? nl is it for this, whate'er my suitors were, nl i favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil? nl is it for this that general count o'reilly, nl who took algiers, declares i used him vilely? nl 'did not the italian musico cazzani nl sing at my heart six months at least in vain? nl did not his countryman, count corniani, nl call me the only virtuous wife in spain? nl were there not also russians, english, many? nl the count strongstroganoff i put in pain, nl and lord mount coffeehouse, the irish peer, nl who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year. nl 'have i not had two bishops at my feet, nl the duke of ichar, and don fernan nunez? nl and is it thus a faithful wife you treat? nl i wonder in what quarter now the moon is: nl i praise your vast forbearance not to beat nl me also, since the time so opportune is— nl o, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger, nl now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure? nl 'was it for this you took your sudden journey. nl under pretence of business indispensable nl with that sublime of rascals your attorney, nl whom i see standing there, and looking sensible nl of having play'd the fool? though both i spurn, he nl deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible, nl because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee, nl and not from any love to you nor me. nl 'if he comes here to take a deposition, nl by all means let the gentleman proceed; nl you 've made the apartment in a fit condition: nl there 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need— nl let every thing be noted with precision, nl i would not you for nothing should be fee'd— nl but, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.' nl 'oh!' sobb'd antonia, 'i could tear their eyes out.' nl 'there is the closet, there the toilet, there nl the antechamber—search them under, over; nl there is the sofa, there the great arm-chair, nl the chimney—which would really hold a lover. nl i wish to sleep, and beg you will take care nl and make no further noise, till you discover nl the secret cavern of this lurking treasure— nl and when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure. nl 'and now, hidalgo! now that you have thrown nl doubt upon me, confusion over all, nl pray have the courtesy to make it known nl who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal nl him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown— nl i hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall? nl tell me—and be assured, that since you stain nl my honour thus, it shall not be in vain. nl 'at least, perhaps, he has not sixty years, nl at that age he would be too old for slaughter, nl or for so young a husband's jealous fears nl (antonia! let me have a glass of water). nl i am ashamed of having shed these tears, nl they are unworthy of my father's daughter; nl my mother dream'd not in my natal hour nl that i should fall into a monster's power. nl 'perhaps 't is of antonia you are jealous, nl you saw that she was sleeping by my side nl when you broke in upon us with your fellows: nl look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide; nl only another time, i trust, you 'll tell us, nl or for the sake of decency abide nl a moment at the door, that we may be nl drest to receive so much good company. nl 'and now, sir, i have done, and say no more; nl the little i have said may serve to show nl the guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er nl the wrongs to whose exposure it is slow: nl i leave you to your conscience as before, nl 't will one day ask you why you used me so? nl god grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!- nl antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?' nl she ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale nl she lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears, nl like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil, nl waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears nl her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail, nl to hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears nl its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart, nl and louder than her breathing beats her heart. nl the senhor don alfonso stood confused; nl antonia bustled round the ransack'd room, nl and, turning up her nose, with looks abused nl her master and his myrmidons, of whom nl not one, except the attorney, was amused; nl he, like achates, faithful to the tomb, nl so there were quarrels, cared not for the cause, nl knowing they must be settled by the laws. nl with prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood, nl following antonia's motions here and there, nl with much suspicion in his attitude; nl for reputations he had little care; nl so that a suit or action were made good, nl small pity had he for the young and fair, nl and ne'er believed in negatives, till these nl were proved by competent false witnesses. nl but don alfonso stood with downcast looks, nl and, truth to say, he made a foolish figure; nl when, after searching in five hundred nooks, nl and treating a young wife with so much rigour, nl he gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes, nl added to those his lady with such vigour nl had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour, nl quick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower. nl at first he tried to hammer an excuse, nl to which the sole reply was tears and sobs, nl and indications of hysterics, whose nl prologue is always certain throes, and throbs, nl gasps, and whatever else the owners choose: nl alfonso saw his wife, and thought of job's; nl he saw too, in perspective, her relations, nl and then he tried to muster all his patience. nl he stood in act to speak, or rather stammer, nl but sage antonia cut him short before nl the anvil of his speech received the hammer, nl with 'pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more, nl or madam dies.'—alfonso mutter'd, 'd—n her,' nl but nothing else, the time of words was o'er; nl he cast a rueful look or two, and did, nl he knew not wherefore, that which he was bid. nl with him retired his 'posse comitatus,' nl the attorney last, who linger'd near the door nl reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as nl antonia let him—not a little sore nl at this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus' nl in don alfonso's facts, which just now wore nl an awkward look; as he revolved the case, nl the door was fasten'd in his legal face. nl no sooner was it bolted, than—oh shame! nl o sin! oh sorrow! and oh womankind! nl how can you do such things and keep your fame, nl unless this world, and t' other too, be blind? nl nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name! nl but to proceed—for there is more behind: nl with much heartfelt reluctance be it said, nl young juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed. nl he had been hid—i don't pretend to say nl how, nor can i indeed describe the where— nl young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay, nl no doubt, in little compass, round or square; nl but pity him i neither must nor may nl his suffocation by that pretty pair; nl 't were better, sure, to die so, than be shut nl with maudlin clarence in his malmsey butt. nl and, secondly, i pity not, because nl he had no business to commit a sin, nl forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws, nl at least 't was rather early to begin; nl but at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws nl so much as when we call our old debts in nl at sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil, nl and find a deuced balance with the devil. nl of his position i can give no notion: nl 't is written in the hebrew chronicle, nl how the physicians, leaving pill and potion, nl prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle, nl when old king david's blood grew dull in motion, nl and that the medicine answer'd very well; nl perhaps 't was in a different way applied, nl for david lived, but juan nearly died. nl what 's to be done? alfonso will be back nl the moment he has sent his fools away. nl antonia's skill was put upon the rack, nl but no device could be brought into play— nl and how to parry the renew'd attack? nl besides, it wanted but few hours of day: nl antonia puzzled; julia did not speak, nl but press'd her bloodless lip to juan's cheek. nl he turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand nl call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair; nl even then their love they could not all command, nl and half forgot their danger and despair: nl antonia's patience now was at a stand— nl 'come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,' nl she whisper'd, in great wrath—'i must deposit nl this pretty gentleman within the closet: nl 'pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night— nl who can have put my master in this mood? nl what will become on 't—i 'm in such a fright, nl the devil 's in the urchin, and no good— nl is this a time for giggling? this a plight? nl why, don't you know that it may end in blood? nl you 'll lose your life, and i shall lose my place, nl my mistress all, for that half-girlish face. nl 'had it but been for a stout cavalier nl of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)— nl but for a child, what piece of work is here! nl i really, madam, wonder at your taste nl (come, sir, get in)—my master must be near: nl there, for the present, at the least, he's fast, nl and if we can but till the morning keep nl our counsel—(juan, mind, you must not sleep).' nl now, don alfonso entering, but alone, nl closed the oration of the trusty maid: nl she loiter'd, and he told her to be gone, nl an order somewhat sullenly obey'd; nl however, present remedy was none, nl and no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd: nl regarding both with slow and sidelong view, nl she snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew. nl alfonso paused a minute—then begun nl some strange excuses for his late proceeding; nl he would not justify what he had done, nl to say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding; nl but there were ample reasons for it, none nl of which he specified in this his pleading: nl his speech was a fine sample, on the whole, nl of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.' nl julia said nought; though all the while there rose nl a ready answer, which at once enables nl a matron, who her husband's foible knows, nl by a few timely words to turn the tables, nl which, if it does not silence, still must pose,— nl even if it should comprise a pack of fables; nl 't is to retort with firmness, and when he nl suspects with one, do you reproach with three. nl julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,— nl alfonso's loves with inez were well known, nl but whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds— nl but that can't be, as has been often shown, nl a lady with apologies abounds;— nl it might be that her silence sprang alone nl from delicacy to don juan's ear, nl to whom she knew his mother's fame was dear. nl there might be one more motive, which makes two; nl alfonso ne'er to juan had alluded,— nl mention'd his jealousy but never who nl had been the happy lover, he concluded, nl conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true, nl his mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded; nl to speak of inez now were, one may say, nl like throwing juan in alfonso's way. nl a hint, in tender cases, is enough; nl silence is best, besides there is a tact nl (that modern phrase appears to me sad stuff, nl but it will serve to keep my verse compact)— nl which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough, nl a lady always distant from the fact: nl the charming creatures lie with such a grace, nl there 's nothing so becoming to the face. nl they blush, and we believe them; at least i nl have always done so; 't is of no great use, nl in any case, attempting a reply, nl for then their eloquence grows quite profuse; nl and when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh, nl and cast their languid eyes down, and let loose nl a tear or two, and then we make it up; nl and then—and then—and then—sit down and sup. nl alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon, nl which julia half withheld, and then half granted, nl and laid conditions he thought very hard on, nl denying several little things he wanted: nl he stood like adam lingering near his garden, nl with useless penitence perplex'd and haunted, nl beseeching she no further would refuse, nl when, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes. nl a pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they nl are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these nl (no one can tell how much i grieve to say) nl were masculine; to see them, and to seize, nl was but a moment's act.—ah! well-a-day! nl my teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze— nl alfonso first examined well their fashion, nl and then flew out into another passion. nl he left the room for his relinquish'd sword, nl and julia instant to the closet flew. nl 'fly, juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word— nl the door is open—you may yet slip through nl the passage you so often have explored— nl here is the garden-key—fly—fly—adieu! nl haste—haste! i hear alfonso's hurrying feet— nl day has not broke—there 's no one in the street: nl none can say that this was not good advice, nl the only mischief was, it came too late; nl of all experience 't is the usual price, nl a sort of income-tax laid on by fate: nl juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice, nl and might have done so by the garden-gate, nl but met alfonso in his dressing-gown, nl who threaten'd death—so juan knock'd him down. nl dire was the scuffle, and out went the light; nl antonia cried out 'rape!' and julia 'fire!' nl but not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight. nl alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire, nl swore lustily he'd be revenged this night; nl and juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher; nl his blood was up: though young, he was a tartar, nl and not at all disposed to prove a martyr. nl alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it, nl and they continued battling hand to hand, nl for juan very luckily ne'er saw it; nl his temper not being under great command, nl if at that moment he had chanced to claw it, nl alfonso's days had not been in the land nl much longer.—think of husbands', lovers' lives! nl and how ye may be doubly widows—wives! nl alfonso grappled to detain the foe, nl and juan throttled him to get away, nl and blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow; nl at last, as they more faintly wrestling lay, nl juan contrived to give an awkward blow, nl and then his only garment quite gave way; nl he fled, like joseph, leaving it; but there, nl i doubt, all likeness ends between the pair. nl lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found nl an awkward spectacle their eyes before; nl antonia in hysterics, julia swoon'd, nl alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door; nl some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground, nl some blood, and several footsteps, but no more: nl juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about, nl and liking not the inside, lock'd the out. nl here ends this canto.—need i sing, or say, nl how juan naked, favour'd by the night, nl who favours what she should not, found his way, nl and reach'd his home in an unseemly plight? nl the pleasant scandal which arose next day, nl the nine days' wonder which was brought to light, nl and how alfonso sued for a divorce, nl were in the english newspapers, of course. nl if you would like to see the whole proceedings, nl the depositions, and the cause at full, nl the names of all the witnesses, the pleadings nl of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul, nl there 's more than one edition, and the readings nl are various, but they none of them are dull; nl the best is that in short-hand ta'en by gurney, nl who to madrid on purpose made a journey. nl but donna inez, to divert the train nl of one of the most circulating scandals nl that had for centuries been known in spain, nl at least since the retirement of the vandals, nl first vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain) nl to virgin mary several pounds of candles; nl and then, by the advice of some old ladies, nl she sent her son to be shipp'd off from cadiz. nl she had resolved that he should travel through nl all european climes, by land or sea, nl to mend his former morals, and get new, nl especially in france and italy nl (at least this is the thing most people do). nl julia was sent into a convent: she nl grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better nl shown in the following copy of her letter:— nl 'they tell me 't is decided; you depart: nl 't is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain; nl i have no further claim on your young heart, nl mine is the victim, and would be again; nl to love too much has been the only art nl i used;—i write in haste, and if a stain nl be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears; nl my eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears. nl 'i loved, i love you, for this love have lost nl state, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem, nl and yet can not regret what it hath cost, nl so dear is still the memory of that dream; nl yet, if i name my guilt, 't is not to boast, nl none can deem harshlier of me than i deem: nl i trace this scrawl because i cannot rest— nl i 've nothing to reproach, or to request. nl 'man's love is of man's life a thing apart, nl 't is woman's whole existence; man may range nl the court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart; nl sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange nl pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart, nl and few there are whom these cannot estrange; nl men have all these resources, we but one, nl to love again, and be again undone. nl 'you will proceed in pleasure, and in pride, nl beloved and loving many; all is o'er nl for me on earth, except some years to hide nl my shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core; nl these i could bear, but cannot cast aside nl the passion which still rages as before— nl and so farewell—forgive me, love me—no, nl that word is idle now—but let it go. nl 'my breast has been all weakness, is so yet; nl but still i think i can collect my mind; nl my blood still rushes where my spirit 's set, nl as roll the waves before the settled wind; nl my heart is feminine, nor can forget— nl to all, except one image, madly blind; nl so shakes the needle, and so stands the pole, nl as vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul. nl 'i have no more to say, but linger still, nl and dare not set my seal upon this sheet, nl and yet i may as well the task fulfil, nl my misery can scarce be more complete: nl i had not lived till now, could sorrow kill; nl death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet, nl and i must even survive this last adieu, nl and bear with life, to love and pray for you!' nl this note was written upon gilt-edged paper nl with a neat little crow-quill, slight and new: nl her small white hand could hardly reach the taper, nl it trembled as magnetic needles do, nl and yet she did not let one tear escape her; nl the seal a sun-flower; 'elle vous suit partout,' nl the motto cut upon a white cornelian; nl the wax was superfine, its hue vermilion. nl this was don juan's earliest scrape; but whether nl i shall proceed with his adventures is nl dependent on the public altogether; nl we 'll see, however, what they say to this: nl their favour in an author's cap 's a feather, nl and no great mischief 's done by their caprice; nl and if their approbation we experience, nl perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence. nl my poem 's epic, and is meant to be nl divided in twelve books;

leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. nl and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft

there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. nl and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they

meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose

franklin that had drunken said, expecting each moment to be her next. also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall

courtly in the cup. woman's woe with wonder pondering. nl now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. there was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable's with other his fellows lynch and madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa, one crotthers, and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir leopold. but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave. nl for they were right witty scholars. and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). and they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. a redress god grant. this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our virgin mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. to whom young stephen had these words following: murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. both babe and parent now glorify their maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. but, gramercy, what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the holy ghost, very god, lord and giver of life? for, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends. but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides. he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's seal, even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his won't was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. that is truth, pardy, said dixon, and, or i err, a pregnant word. which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. nl but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores. nl about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray. now

to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided. he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate

quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion. well met they were, said master dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named beau mount and lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling

plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne's hall. he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon. nl but was young boasthard's fear vanquished by calmer's words? no, for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away. and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal? indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle. heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or, what calmer said, a hubbub of phenomenon? heard? why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding (which he had not done). for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law. then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe-on-me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? yes, pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two-in-the-bush or, by some learned, carnal concupiscence. nl this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird-in-the-hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. for regarding believe-on-me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, two-in-the-bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and, second, for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild. so were they all in their blind fancy, mr cavil and mr sometimes godly, mr ape swillale, mr false franklin, mr dainty dixon, young boasthard and mr cautious calmer. wherein, o wretched company, were ye all deceived for

three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how. nl with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. he took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. the other, costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. faith, no, he says, frank (that was his name), 'tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. but they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. there's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. _mort aux vaches_, says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too. from a child this frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. one time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. what, says mr leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats, says he. i can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low's yard in prussia street. i question with you there, says he. more like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. mr stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over doctor rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. come, come, says mr vincent, plain dealing. he'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's irish, says he. irish by name and irish by nature, says mr stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an irish bull in an english chinashop. i conceive you, says mr dixon. it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. true for you, says mr vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. he had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. what for that, says mr dixon, but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. so be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. but the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says mr vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland. another then put in his word: and they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. by this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: by the lord harry, green is the grass that grows on the ground. and, says mr dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry's orders. there was bad blood between them at first, says mr vincent, and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i'll meddle in his matters, says he. i'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. but one evening, says mr dixon, when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans, _bos bovum_, which is good bog latin for boss of the show. after that, says mr vincent, the lord harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. in short, he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. they were, says mr stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america. which was the occasion, says mr vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: nl _--pope peter's but a pissabed. a man's a man for a' that._ nl our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name alec bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _mr malachi mulligan. fertiliser and incubator. lambay island_. his project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said mr dixon. i make no doubt it smacks of wenching. come, be seated, both. 'tis as cheap sitting as standing. mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. it grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. to curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder, lord talbot de malahide, a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. they both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by mr mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle. mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, o quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck. nl valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. the young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. mr mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. mr dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, mr austin meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. for answer mr mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): there's a belly that never bore a bastard. this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. nl here the listener who was none other than the scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. that you may and very opportunely. there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. but, gracious heaven, was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my god, i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things. with these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, ah, monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. i declare, i was never so touched in all my life. god, i thank thee, as the author of my days! thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. but indeed, sir, i wander from the point. how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! i could weep to think of it. then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. but beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, i know of a _marchand de capotes_, monsieur poyntz, from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. tut, tut! cries le fecondateur, tripping in, my friend monsieur moore, that most accomplished traveller (i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in cape horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. a drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. pooh! a _livre!_ cries monsieur lynch. the clumsy things are dear at a sou. one umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. no woman of any wit would wear one. my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. the first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as i handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. nl amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, miss callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. strike me silly, said costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! i'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. what, you dog? have you a way with them? gad's bud, immensely so, said mr lynch. the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice. demme, does not doctor o'gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! drat the man! bless me, i'm all of a wibbly wobbly. why, you're as bad as dear little father cantekissem, that you are! may this pot of four half choke me, cried costello, if she ain't in the family way. i knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her. the young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. i want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. i cannot away with them. what? malign such an one, the amiable miss callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? perish the thought! i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne. having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart. nl to revert to mr bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. the young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin. it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. to conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being. nl accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. the dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron. i must acquaint you, said mr crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old glory allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. 'slife, i'll be round with you. i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. all fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. but, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together. nl but with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. he says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with hagar, the egyptian! in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. it ill becomes him to preach that gospel. has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative. nl the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, when he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen (cited by mr candidate mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers _sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. the abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. the hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses. the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus. hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined. nl but malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. he conjured up the scene before them. the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... haines! which of us did not feel his flesh creep! he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _poison._ surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. i anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. yes, it is true. i am the murderer of samuel childs. and how i am punished! the inferno has no terrors for me. this is the appearance is on me. tare and ages, what way would i be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? my hell, and ireland's, is in this life. it is what i tried to obliterate my crime. distractions, rookshooting, the erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. in vain! his spectre stalks me. dope is my only hope... ah! destruction! the black panther! with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven. he was gone. tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. the seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: the vendetta of mananaun! the sage repeated: _lex talionis_. the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. the mystery was unveiled. haines was the third brother. his real name was childs. the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. he drank drugs to obliterate. for this relief much thanks. the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. no soul will live there. the spider pitches her web in the solitude. the nocturnal rat peers from his hole. a curse is on it. it is haunted. murderer's ground. nl what is the age of the soul of man? as she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. no longer is leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. a score of years are blown away. he is young leopold. there, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. that young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. the scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a month before. but hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. who can say? the wise father knows his own child. he thinks of a drizzling night in hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. bridie! bridie kelly! he will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. they are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. did heart leap to heart? nay, fair reader. in a breath 'twas done but--hold! back! it must not be! in terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. she is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. no, leopold. name and memory solace thee not. that youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. no son of thy loins is by thee. there is none now to be for leopold, what leopold was for rudolph. nl the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. a region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. she follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. they fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. netaim, the golden, is no more. and on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. huuh! hark! huuh! parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. elk and yak, the bulls of bashan and of babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _lacus mortis_. ominous revengeful zodiacal host! they moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun. nl onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. and the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of virgo. and lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. it is she, martha, thou lost one, millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. how serene does she now arise, a queen among the pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. it floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus. nl francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee's time. he asked about glaucon, alcibiades, pisistratus. where were they now? neither knew. you have spoken of the past and its phantoms, stephen said. why think of them? if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? who supposes it? i, bous stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at vincent. that answer and those leaves, vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. all who wish you well hope this for you. all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you stephaneforos. i heartily wish you may not fail them. o no, vincent lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. have no fear. he could not leave his mother an orphan. the young man's face grew dark. all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: lenehan as much more. he told them of the race. the flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. madden up. she was leading the field. all hearts were beating. even phyllis could not contain herself. she waved her scarf and cried: huzzah! sceptre wins! but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. all was lost now. phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. juno, she cried, i am undone. but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. a tear fell: one only. a whacking fine whip, said lenehan, is w. lane. four winners yesterday and three today. what rider is like him? mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. but let us bear it as was the ancient won't. mercy on the luckless! poor sceptre! he said with a light sigh. she is not the filly that she was. never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. by gad, sir, a queen of them. do you remember her, vincent? i wish you could have seen my queen today, vincent said. how young she was and radiant (lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, i do not know the right name of it. the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close. a week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. she is more taking then. her posies tool mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. and in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. conmee himself! he was walking by the hedge, reading, i think a brevier book with, i doubt not, a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page. the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. but he had been kind. in going by he had blessed us. the gods too are ever kind, lenehan said. if i had poor luck with bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. he was laying his hand upon a winejar: malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. warily, malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. his soul is far away. it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. do you not think it, stephen? theosophos told me so, stephen answered, whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. the lords of the moon, theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation. nl however, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton-on-trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. he was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. nl the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. the debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. the high hall of horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. a gallant scene in truth it made. crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway. there too, opposite to him, was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden. the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan. lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come. nl it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s. dedalus' (div. scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. there may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as culpepper, spallanzani, blumenbach, lusk, hertwig, leopold and valenti, a mixture of both? this would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. it is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. mr m. mulligan (hyg. et eug. doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. these factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. mr j. crotthers (disc. bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v. lynch (bacc. arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. mr s. dedalus' (div. scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. in a recent public controversy with mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the national maternity hospital, 29, 30 and 31 holles street, of which, as is well known, dr a. horne (lic. in midw., f. k. q. c. p. i.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. at the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered. nl meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ it had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. she had. she had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above, the universal husband. and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of god's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. he is older now (you and i may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank, college green branch. o doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! with the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. god! how beautiful now across the mist of years! but their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, charley, mary alice, frederick albert (if he had lived), mamy, budgy (victoria frances), tom, violet constance louisa, darling little bobsy (called after our famous hero of the south african war, lord bobs of waterford and candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a purefoy if ever there was one, with the true purefoy nose. young hopeful will be christened mortimer edward after the influential third cousin of mr purefoy in the treasury remembrancer's office, dublin castle. and so time wags on: but father cronion has dealt lightly here. no, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle mina. and doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. he knows and will call in his own good time. you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. sir, to you my hand. well done, thou good and faithful servant! nl there are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. he may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful. nl the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. a scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, floey, atty, tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then, our lady of the cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. he frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles vergangliche_) in her glad look. nl mark this farther and remember. the end comes suddenly. enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long ago. but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word. nl burke's! outflings my lord stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes,

was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was

childless. nl and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon. and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. nl and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. nl and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. thanked be almighty god. nl this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. meseems it dureth overlong. and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. but, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. and the franklin that had drunken said, expecting each moment to be her next. also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. woman's woe with wonder pondering. nl now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. there was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable's with other his fellows lynch and madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa, one crotthers, and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir leopold. but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave. nl for they were right witty scholars. and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne's house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). and they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. a redress god grant. this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our virgin mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. to whom young stephen had these words following: murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. both babe and parent now glorify their maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. but, gramercy, what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the holy ghost, very god, lord and giver of life? for, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends. but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi's praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides. he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god's greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's seal, even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his won't was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. that is truth, pardy, said dixon, and, or i err, a pregnant word. which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. nl but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores. nl about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray. now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul's bodiment. leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. see ye here. and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. his words were then these as followeth: know all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. what means this? desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. mark me now. in woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. this is the postcreation. _omnis caro ad te veniet_. no question but her name is puissant who

an almightiness of petition because she is the second eve and she won us, saith augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold

to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided. he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate

rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming words

natural phenomenon. nl but was young boasthard's fear vanquished by calmer's words? no, for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away. and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal? indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle. heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or, what calmer said, a hubbub of phenomenon? heard? why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding (which he had not done). for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law. then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe-on-me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king

pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two-in-the-bush or, by some learned, carnal concupiscence. nl this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird-in-the-hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. for regarding believe-on-me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, two-in-the-bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets

three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how. nl with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. he took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. the other, costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. faith, no, he says, frank (that was his name), 'tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. but they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. there's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. _mort aux vaches_, says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too. from a child this frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. one time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. what, says mr leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats, says he. i can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low's yard in prussia street. i question with you there, says he. more like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. mr stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over doctor rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. come, come, says mr vincent, plain dealing. he'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's irish, says he. irish by name and irish by nature, says mr stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an irish bull in an english chinashop. i conceive you, says mr dixon. it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. true for you, says mr vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. he had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. what for that, says mr dixon, but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. so be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. but the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says mr vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland. another then put in his word: and they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. by this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: by the lord harry, green is the grass that grows on the ground. and, says mr dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry's orders. there was bad blood between them at first, says mr vincent, and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i'll meddle in his matters, says he. i'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. but one evening, says mr dixon, when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans, _bos bovum_, which is good bog latin for boss of the show. after that, says mr vincent, the lord harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. in short, he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. they were, says mr stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america. which was the occasion, says mr vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: nl _--pope peter's but a pissabed. a man's a man for a' that._ nl our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name alec bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell's bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _mr malachi mulligan. fertiliser and incubator. lambay island_. his project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said mr dixon. i make no doubt it smacks of wenching. come, be seated, both. 'tis as cheap sitting as standing. mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. it grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. to curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder, lord talbot de malahide, a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. they both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by mr mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle. mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, o quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck. nl valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. the young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. mr mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of horne's house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. mr dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, mr austin meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. for answer mr mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): there's a belly that never bore a bastard. this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. nl here the listener who was none other than the scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. that you may and very opportunely. there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. but, gracious heaven, was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my god, i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things. with these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, ah, monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. i declare, i was never so touched in all my life. god, i thank thee, as the author of my days! thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. but indeed, sir, i wander from the point. how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! i could weep to think of it. then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. but beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, i know of a _marchand de capotes_, monsieur poyntz, from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. tut, tut! cries le fecondateur, tripping in, my friend monsieur moore, that most accomplished traveller (i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in cape horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. a drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. pooh! a _livre!_ cries monsieur lynch. the clumsy things are dear at a sou. one umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. no woman of any wit would wear one. my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. the first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as i handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. nl amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, miss callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. strike me silly, said costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! i'll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. what, you dog? have you a way with them? gad's bud, immensely so, said mr lynch. the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice. demme, does not doctor o'gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! drat the man! bless me, i'm all of a wibbly wobbly. why, you're as bad as dear little father cantekissem, that you are! may this pot of four half choke me, cried costello, if she ain't in the family way. i knows a lady what's got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her. the young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. i want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. i cannot away with them. what? malign such an one, the amiable miss callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? perish the thought! i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne. having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart. nl to revert to mr bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. the young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin. it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. to conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being. nl accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. the dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron. i must acquaint you, said mr crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old glory allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. 'slife, i'll be round with you. i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. all fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. but, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together. nl but with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. he says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with hagar, the egyptian! in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. it ill becomes him to preach that gospel. has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative. nl the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, when he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen (cited by mr candidate mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers _sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. the abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. the hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses. the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus. hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined. nl but malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. he conjured up the scene before them. the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... haines! which of us did not feel his flesh creep! he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _poison._ surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. i anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. yes, it is true. i am the murderer of samuel childs. and how i am punished! the inferno has no terrors for me. this is the appearance is on me. tare and ages, what way would i be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? my hell, and ireland's, is in this life. it is what i tried to obliterate my crime. distractions, rookshooting, the erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. in vain! his spectre stalks me. dope is my only hope... ah! destruction! the black panther! with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven. he was gone. tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. the seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: the vendetta of mananaun! the sage repeated: _lex talionis_. the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. the mystery was unveiled. haines was the third brother. his real name was childs. the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. he drank drugs to obliterate. for this relief much thanks. the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. no soul will live there. the spider pitches her web in the solitude. the nocturnal rat peers from his hole. a curse is on it. it is haunted. murderer's ground. nl what is the age of the soul of man? as she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. no longer is leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. a score of years are blown away. he is young leopold. there, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. that young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother's thought. or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. the scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with jacob's pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a month before. but hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist. now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. who can say? the wise father knows his own child. he thinks of a drizzling night in hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. bridie! bridie kelly! he will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight. they are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat_!) light shall flood the world. did heart leap to heart? nay, fair reader. in a breath 'twas done but--hold! back! it must not be! in terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. she is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. no, leopold. name and memory solace thee not. that youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee--and in vain. no son of thy loins is by thee. there is none now to be for leopold, what leopold was for rudolph. nl the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived. a region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. she follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. they fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. netaim, the golden, is no more. and on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. huuh! hark! huuh! parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. elk and yak, the bulls of bashan and of babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _lacus mortis_. ominous revengeful zodiacal host! they moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun. nl onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. and the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of virgo. and lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. it is she, martha, thou lost one, millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. how serene does she now arise, a queen among the pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer. it floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus. nl francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee's time. he asked about glaucon, alcibiades, pisistratus. where were they now? neither knew. you have spoken of the past and its phantoms, stephen said. why think of them? if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? who supposes it? i, bous stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at vincent. that answer and those leaves, vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. all who wish you well hope this for you. all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you stephaneforos. i heartily wish you may not fail them. o no, vincent lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. have no fear. he could not leave his mother an orphan. the young man's face grew dark. all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: lenehan as much more. he told them of the race. the flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. madden up. she was leading the field. all hearts were beating. even phyllis could not contain herself. she waved her scarf and cried: huzzah! sceptre wins! but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. all was lost now. phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. juno, she cried, i am undone. but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. a tear fell: one only. a whacking fine whip, said lenehan, is w. lane. four winners yesterday and three today. what rider is like him? mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. but let us bear it as was the ancient won't. mercy on the luckless! poor sceptre! he said with a light sigh. she is not the filly that she was. never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. by gad, sir, a queen of them. do you remember her, vincent? i wish you could have seen my queen today, vincent said. how young she was and radiant (lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, i do not know the right name of it. the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close. a week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. she is more taking then. her posies tool mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. and in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. conmee himself! he was walking by the hedge, reading, i think a brevier book with, i doubt not, a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page. the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. but he had been kind. in going by he had blessed us. the gods too are ever kind, lenehan said. if i had poor luck with bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. he was laying his hand upon a winejar: malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. warily, malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. his soul is far away. it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. do you not think it, stephen? theosophos told me so, stephen answered, whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. the lords of the moon, theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation. nl however, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton-on-trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance. he was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. nl the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life. neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. the debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. the high hall of horne's house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic. a gallant scene in truth it made. crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway. there too, opposite to him, was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom. next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden. the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan. lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come. nl it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s. dedalus' (div. scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. there may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as culpepper, spallanzani, blumenbach, lusk, hertwig, leopold and valenti, a mixture of both? this would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_ of the passive element. the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. it is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. mr m. mulligan (hyg. et eug. doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. these factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. mr j. crotthers (disc. bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v. lynch (bacc. arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. mr s. dedalus' (div. scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. in a recent public controversy with mr l. bloom (pubb. canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the national maternity hospital, 29, 30 and 31 holles street, of which, as is well known, dr a. horne (lic. in midw., f. k. q. c. p. i.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. at the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered. nl meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ it had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped. she had. she had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above, the universal husband. and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of god's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. he is older now (you and i may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank, college green branch. o doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! with the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. god! how beautiful now across the mist of years! but their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, charley, mary alice, frederick albert (if he had lived), mamy, budgy (victoria frances), tom, violet constance louisa, darling little bobsy (called after our famous hero of the south african war, lord bobs of waterford and candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a purefoy if ever there was one, with the true purefoy nose. young hopeful will be christened mortimer edward after the influential third cousin of mr purefoy in the treasury remembrancer's office, dublin castle. and so time wags on: but father cronion has dealt lightly here. no, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle mina. and doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. he knows and will call in his own good time. you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. sir, to you my hand. well done, thou good and faithful servant! nl there are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait. he may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful. nl the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. a scene disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, floey, atty, tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then, our lady of the cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. he frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles vergangliche_) in her glad look. nl mark this farther and remember. the end comes suddenly. enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long ago. but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word. nl burke's! outflings my lord stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes,
